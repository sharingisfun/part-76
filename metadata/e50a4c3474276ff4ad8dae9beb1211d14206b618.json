He's holding the line on taxes and drawing a line on the debt ceiling,\n\nEd welcomed House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer(D-MD) for the latest fiscal cliff developments and the Democratic line on Medicare.\n\nThen, how is President Obama supposed to negotiate with Republicans who won't recognize reality or deal with the facts? Ed asked former Rep.Tom Perriello (D-VA).\n\nPaul Ryan and Marco Rubio try to re-invent themselves as warriors for the middle class. Ed checked in with Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, (D-FL) Chair of the Democratic National Committee, to see if their actions match up with their rhetoric.\n\nVoter suppression across the country was a man-made disaster. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) has a new plan to end it and she joined Ed Wednesday to explain it.\n\nAnd in the Big Finish, a new poll showed half of all Republicans thought the defunct group Acorn stole the election for President Obama. Ed talked with Karen Finney (MSNBC Political Analyst and former DNC Communications Director), about the GOP's alternate reality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e50a4c3474276ff4ad8dae9beb1211d14206b618","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+12-5-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e50a4c3474276ff4ad8dae9beb1211d14206b618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,10,76,52,116,39,111,244,173,141,174,155,235,18,17,209,66,6,182,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
