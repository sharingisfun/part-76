As an uploader, people asking the same question when the answer is almost always the same is very annoying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e3c4b568ee4cc76b17cc01b3a5818fbf9a95bac","amp;dn":"World_Soccer_Winning_Eleven_2012_JAP_PS2DVD-STORMAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e3c4b568ee4cc76b17cc01b3a5818fbf9a95bac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,60,75,86,142,228,204,118,177,124,192,27,58,88,24,251,249,169,91,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
