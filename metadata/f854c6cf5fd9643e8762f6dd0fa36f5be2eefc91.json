The default recording level of 1 may not be optimal for your \n\ndevice, so you may need to play around with that setting to get good recordings..\n\nIf you hear excessive static during playback, try lowering your recording volume \n\nand make a new recording using this lower recording volume setting.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST:\n\nIf you are unable to record audio using this app, try the following:\n\nCHECK 1: Speak closely into the microphone.\n\nCHECK 2: Raise the speaker volume on your phone/device.\n\nCHECK 3: Raise the recording volume from within the app.\n\nCHECK 4: Also, if you have a bluetooth headset and you are not able to record audio \n\nor just get static, try turning your bluetooth headset off and see if that resolves \n\nthe issue.\n\n\nCHECK 5: From within the app, try selecting a different audio recording rate, via \n\nMenu-&gt;Prefs.
