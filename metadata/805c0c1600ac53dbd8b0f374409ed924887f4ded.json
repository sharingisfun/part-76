All the members of Total Issue came from the jazz circuit and the music they have created was guitar-dominated rock (mostly sung in English) with some jazz and good folk inÃ¯Â¬â€šuences similar to early Jethro Tull (with distinct references to Van Der Graaf Generator, Genesis and King Crimson), but with clear Ã¢â‚¬Ëœless Anderson / more BarreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ approach! The record was Ã¯Â¬ï¿½lled with varied, imaginative and cleverly-arranged songs based mostly on spacey bass lines, nicely distorted electric guitar sounds and some pleasant flute passages. ltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an album which can't be missed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:805c0c1600ac53dbd8b0f374409ed924887f4ded","amp;dn":"Total+Issue+-+Total+Issue+%281971%2F2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"805c0c1600ac53dbd8b0f374409ed924887f4ded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,92,12,22,0,172,83,219,216,176,243,116,64,158,217,36,136,127,77,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
