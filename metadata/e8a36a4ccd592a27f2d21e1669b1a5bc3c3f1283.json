Alex discusses how the people of Egypt came together to oust their Western-backed globalist puppet and overthrow the Muslim Brotherhood in a revolution that has sent the Obama administration reeling. \n\nAlex also covers the massive police state presence and TSA checkpoints in major towns across the U.S. suppressing the true spirit and meaning of the Fourth of July. \n\nFinancial pundit Max Keiser also joins Alex on today's show to analyze the imploding bond market. \n\nAlex will also continue to explore the latest NSA spy-gate scandal revelations and other major news items.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
