Debbie Wasserman Schultz, (D-FL) (Chair of the Democratic National Committee), to discuss the president's mandate for a new nationalism and fairness.\n\nLabor unions came out in force to help re-elect President Obama and they're teaming up again to help spread the president's plan to avoid the fiscal cliff. Leo Gerard (United Steel Workers International President), joined Ed for that.\n\nThe right wing freaked out over the resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus. The Ed Show looked at their latest conspiracy theories about the timing of the general's resignation with Richard Wolffe (Exec. Editor, MSNBC.com and MSNBC Political Analyst).\n\nThe immigration evolution continues on the right. Ruy Teixeira (Senior Fellow, Center for American Progress), saw it all coming.\n\nAmerica's most powerful lobbyist is reduced to shoolyard name-calling. Ed showed why Grover Norquist has a lot to worry about.\n\nAnd in the Big Finish, a pizza chain CEO said President Obama's health care law was going to cost his customers and his employees. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sam Stein (Huffington Post political editor), had the details.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da9a7da02678350de17bdd2525bf355310fddaa8","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+11-12-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da9a7da02678350de17bdd2525bf355310fddaa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,154,125,160,38,120,53,13,225,123,221,37,37,191,53,83,16,253,218,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
