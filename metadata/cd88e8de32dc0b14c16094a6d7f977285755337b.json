He malingers during boot camp, but makes it through as a sniper, paired with the usually-reliable Troy. The Gulf War breaks out, and his unit goes to Saudi Arabia for Desert Shield. After 175 days of boredom, adrenaline, heat, worry about his girlfriend finding someone else, losing it and nearly killing a mate, demotion, latrine cleaning, faulty gas masks, and desert football, Desert Storm begins. In less than five days, it's over, but not before Swoff sees burned bodies, flaming oil derricks, an oil-drenched horse, and maybe a chance at killing. Where does all the testosterone go\n\n==============\n\nmedia info:\n\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 4 639 Kbps\nLength            : 3.98 GiB for 2h 2mn 42s 400ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 3 999 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 544 (2.353) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : english\n\n==============\n\nsubtitle file[yes]\n\nsample[yes]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd88e8de32dc0b14c16094a6d7f977285755337b","amp;dn":"Jarhead-2005-720p+BDRip+x264+Ac3+5.1.mp4-Winker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd88e8de32dc0b14c16094a6d7f977285755337b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,136,232,222,50,220,11,20,193,96,148,166,215,249,119,40,87,85,51,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
