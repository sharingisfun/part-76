One of the first documentaries about Wood, it includes interviews with Conrad Brooks, Kathy Wood (Ed's widow), ex-girlfriend and actress Dolores Fuller, Joe Robertson, softcore porn director Stephen Apostolof . . . and dozens of clips of dialogue from Ed'sReally good. The tone of the film is mildly contemptuous and affectionate at the same time, which is strange.\n\nThis is the Rhino Video version released on VHS in the mid 1990s, which has a superior audio track to the version that later appeared on DVD which played like a rough cut (the sort of gaffe one came to expect from Rhino over the years).\n\nHope you enjoy it.
