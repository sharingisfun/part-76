There is only one other torrent on PB that has this...and that douche is not seeding.  So here ya go.  \n\nThis came from xdark 4.2, the 64bit version.  There are a TON of windows apps here.\n\nI have used quite a few of these. the custom xdark apps( bottom of the list) are pretty cool.\n\nInstallation is simple...just download the iso. Mount it.Run WPI.exe\nYou will have a number of screens to navigate, which groups all the apps into specific categories.\n\nI have included a txt file, with a complete listing of all the apps.\n\npeace\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b06bd261a78ab2566233651aed8f82ebf024be2e","amp;dn":"xdark+Applibrary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b06bd261a78ab2566233651aed8f82ebf024be2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,107,210,97,167,138,178,86,98,51,101,26,237,143,130,235,240,36,190,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
