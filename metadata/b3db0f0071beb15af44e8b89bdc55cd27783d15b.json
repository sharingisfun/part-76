Not the most exciting of races, but exciting in a big picture sort of way. Jimmie Johnson and Brad Keselowski enter into the race just 20 points apart in the standings. If Jimmie wins (and leads the most laps) Keselowski has to finish 15th or better to win the championship.\n\n\nThanks to everyone that downloads, this is my first of hopefully many torrents. I'll be trying to provide lots of races. Audio sync is a little off at the end and I apologize, had trouble trying to get the synchronization to work out right. Hope you enjoy the show!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3db0f0071beb15af44e8b89bdc55cd27783d15b","amp;dn":"%5BRace-Vids%5BNASCAR+-+Sprint+Cup+-+2012+-+Homestead-Miami+Speedway","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3db0f0071beb15af44e8b89bdc55cd27783d15b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,219,15,0,113,190,177,90,244,78,139,137,189,197,92,210,119,131,209,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
