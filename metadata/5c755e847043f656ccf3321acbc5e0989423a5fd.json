In the early morning weekend hours, I listened to this album on repeat and thought about how it might be that those two instruments might never have been used so perfectly as background accompaniment in a jam, specifically Ã¢â‚¬Å“FinderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s KeepersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, before. They do not own this song Ã¢â‚¬â€ they are not loud or overpowering Ã¢â‚¬â€ but like a chorus of mere voices in the background. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be the only one that thinks this fiddle and this harmonica is telling a story as great as these lyricsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nDo not let anyone tell you any different: This album, Streams and Pastures, is roots perfection.\n\nSunday morning the sun made its first appearance here in months. The grass seemed to turn green overnight and that night, I stood in the middle of the road and listened to bugs makes noises I have not heard in many moons. I awoke and turned off the albums IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been using to soothe my winter depression (PhosphorescentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Muchacho and the latest Frightened Rabbit) and put this on instead. I closed my eyes and imagined everything blooming again. This album was the soundtrack to thatÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let anyone tell you any different: This album, Streams and Pastures, is the best on a morning when the sun has appeared and brought with it growth. It is perfect for ushering out winter sadness and carrying in, on its mighty shoulders, SpringÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delight and happiness.\n\nI played this album and nothing but all day Sunday. I put it on as soon as I woke this morning. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m tempted to let it become the only thing I listen to in the near future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c755e847043f656ccf3321acbc5e0989423a5fd","amp;dn":"Whetherman+-+Streams+and+Pastures+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c755e847043f656ccf3321acbc5e0989423a5fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,117,94,132,112,67,246,86,204,243,50,26,203,197,224,152,148,35,165,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
