But in 1910, a single copy of the gospel of John came into this village and changed the course of history for the Hmar people. Through that single copy of John's Gospel, Chawnga, the father of Rochunga Pudaite, was introduced to a revolutionary &quot;new life in Christ.&quot; He and a few tribesmen &quot;forsook all and followed Christ.&quot; Chawnga believed that Rochunga was God's chosen instrument to bring the Scriptures to the entire Hmar tribe in their own language. This is the story of Rochunga's personal pilgrimage. It is an unforgettable saga of his dedication to a vision and of the Lord's direction in his life.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.
