John Kress, David L. Erickson, &quot;DNA Barcodes: Methods and Protocols&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 1617795909 | 2012 | PDF | 485 pages | 7,6 mb\n\nA DNA barcode in its simplest definition is one or more short gene sequences taken from a standardized portion of the genome that is used to identify species through reference to DNA sequence libraries or databases. In DNA Barcodes: Methods and Protocols expert researchers in the field detail many of the methods which are now commonly used with DNA barcodes. These methods include the latest information on techniques for generating, applying, and analyzing DNA barcodes across the Tree of Life including animals, fungi, protists, algae, and plants. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular BiologyÃ¢â€žÂ¢ series format, the chapters include the kind of detailed description and implementation advice that is crucial for getting optimal results in the laboratory. Thorough and intuitive, DNA Barcodes: Methods and Protocols aids scientists in continuing to study methods from wet-lab protocols, statistical, and ecological analyses along with guides to future, large-scale collections campaigns.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3be042adf45251542f051fa6c262fe3da45a264f","amp;dn":"DNA+Barcodes+Methods+and+Protocols","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3be042adf45251542f051fa6c262fe3da45a264f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,224,66,173,244,82,81,84,47,5,31,166,194,98,254,61,164,90,38,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
