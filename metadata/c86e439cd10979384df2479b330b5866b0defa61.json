Suppose the unthinkable happens while you're under deadline to finish a project Ã¢â‚¬â€ your Mac is unresponsive and all you hear is an ominous, repetitive clicking noise coming from its hard drive. With ordinary backups, you'll spend your day rushing out to a store to buy a new hard drive and then sit in front of your computer reinstalling the operating system and restoring data.\n\nWith Carbon Copy Cloner, your data and the operating system's data are all preserved impeccably on a bootable volume, ready for production at a moment's notice. When disaster strikes, simply boot from your backup and get back to business. Replace the failed hard drive at your convenience, and then restore all of your stuff in one easy step.\n\nAny backup application can save your stuff. A CCC bootable backup will save your productivity as well!\n\n\nTHIS IS THE OLD FREE VERSION OF CARBON COPY CLONER. The new one requires you to pay!!!!  This will work on Lion and Mountain Lion just fine.  \n\nAll you need to do is click Help, Donate to Bombich Software, then click &quot;I donated&quot;.  Once you've done that you're good to go.
