People who are terminally ill and live in Oregon or Washington can openly ask a doctor for help, but in the rest of country, where physician-assisted suicide is illegal, people who are suffering turn in secret to friends, family members, and even activist organizations. In this groundbreaking 90-minute film, FRONTLINE explores the shadow world of assisted suicide, where the lines between legality and criminality are blurred as never before. With intimate access to decisions near the end of life, FRONTLINE takes viewers inside one of the most polarizing social issues of our time - told not only by the people choosing to die, but also by their &quot;assisters,&quot; individuals and right-to-die organizations at risk of prosecution for their actions to hasten death. \n--------------------------------\nDVD - http://www.shoppbs.org\n\nWeb - http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/suicide-plan/\n--------------------------------\nDuration...........: 01:23:41\nFile size..........: 543 MiB\nResolution.........: 640x360\n\nScreenshots:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5b8b3d8bdcccd79b7489743ea9758165df77fd3","amp;dn":"The.Suicide.Plan.2012.PBS.FRONTLINE.WebRip.GT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5b8b3d8bdcccd79b7489743ea9758165df77fd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,184,179,216,189,204,205,121,183,72,151,67,234,151,88,22,93,247,127,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
