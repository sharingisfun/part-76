So I am putting it here for you guys to enjoy.\n\nThis is a Blizzard Like Server which you can run on your home computer and can be used to play offline and single player World of Warcraft mode.  This repack is for client Version 3.3.5 which you can find here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5897534/World_of_Warcraft_-_3.3.5a_(12340)_-_enUS_(No_Install)\n\nJust open it up and go to the WTF Folder, and edit file realm.wtf to say 127.0.0.1 instead of the IP that is there.  \n\n1.) Extract to C: \n2.) Go to Server Folder and open MySQL.bat\n3.) Go to Trinity Folder and open authserver.exe and worldserver.exe\n4.) Start Wow.exe from your game client version 3.3.5a required. \n5.) Login your offline/private server using login: admin password: admin \n6.) Optional:  Give your friends your IP and tell them to edit the realms.wtf file to your IP (If you want people to play with you, or you can list your server and make it public)\n\n\n\n    Death Knights are working 97% as Working\n    Druids are working 95% as Working\n    Hunters are working 98% as Working\n    Mages are working 97% as Working\n    Paladins are working 96% as Working\n    Priests are working 96% as Working\n    Rogues are working 97% as Working\n    Shamans are working 99% as Working\n    Warlocks are working 97% as Working\n    Warriors are working 97% as Working\n\n\n\n\n    Dungeons:\n        All Classic Dungeons Working and Scripted\n        All Burning Crusade Dungeons Working and Scripted\n        All Wrath of the Lich King Dungeons Working and Scripted\n\n\n    Raids:\n\n        All Classic Raids Working and Scripted\n        All Burning Crusade Raids and Scripted\n        All Wrath of the Lich King Raids and Scripted\n\n\n\n\n    Most Quests are Working\n    Most Achivements Working\n    Dungeon Finder is Working\n    Death Knight starting area is Working\n    The auction house is Working\n    Vehicles are Working\n\n\n\n\nIn-Game:\n\nUsername: admin\nPassword: admin\n\nDatabase:\n\nUsername: root\nPassword: ascent\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6d7f52e279bf947f95d37268c791592ed3e010","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft+Server+Emulator+Blizzard+Like+Single+Player","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6d7f52e279bf947f95d37268c791592ed3e010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,109,127,82,226,121,191,148,127,149,211,114,104,199,145,89,46,211,224,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
