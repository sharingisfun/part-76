Moving from theoretical concerns to empirical analysis, he focuses on the crucial role of three institutions that foster protest: black churches, black colleges, and Southern chapters of the NAACP. He concludes that political opportunities, a heightened sense of political efficacy, and the development of these three institutions played a central role in shaping the civil rights movement. In his new introduction, McAdam revisits the civil rights struggle in light of recent scholarship on social movement origins and collective action.\n\n&quot;[A] first-rate analytical demonstration that the civil rights movement was the culmination of a long process of building institutions in the black community.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Raymond Wolters, Journal of American History\n\n&quot;A fresh, rich, and dynamic model to explain the rise and decline of the black insurgency movement in the United States.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€James W.
