Tuscaloosa, Alabama's Gideon are a no holds barred, in-your-face hardcore band with an already impressive repertoire. Well-placed gang vocals and a powerful front man set Gideon apart from many of their peers, while the band as a whole, whose members have been playing together only since 2008, come off sounding like seasoned pros. Their Facedown debut Costs (engineered by Brian Hood) will be released on March 1, 2011 and will be supported by non stop touring including Facedown Fest in Pomona, CA (April) and Cornerstone Festival in Bushnell, IL (July). See a list of current tour dates below. \n\n\n1. Gutter\n2. Bad Blood\n3. No Acceptance\n4. Overthrow\n5. Prodigal Son\n6. Mask\n7. Still Alive\n8. Milestone\n9. Maternity \n10. Coward\n11.
