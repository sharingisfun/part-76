Eventually, Microsoft will remove and phase out this package, and we need an archive somewhere.\n\nThere are some old programs that will still require DirectMusic, and I don't know how long those programs will last.\n\nThe Pirate Bay is the place to put up a mirror ideally. No fuss, no hassle, and it's easy to upload/create a mirror/backup. I'm happy with it as it is.\n\nIf anyone is willingly to put this somewhere safe and in a place where people can still obtain this SDK package, please, by all means, go ahead!\n\nLeave any comments below. Feedback is appreciated.\n\nEnjoy! :D\n\nThere's no Bayimg image tag for this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9385d9dbdceb75c6f7bcbba016a5b9b815e6ed8c","amp;dn":"DirectX+9+SDK+-+April+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9385d9dbdceb75c6f7bcbba016a5b9b815e6ed8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,133,217,219,220,235,117,198,247,188,187,160,22,165,185,184,21,230,237,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
