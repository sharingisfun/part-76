But labor groups have taken to the airwaves to make sure they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get weak kneed about the &quot;Fiscal cliff.&quot;\n\nEd welcomed Sen.Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Leo Gerard (United Steel Workers International President), to comment on Tuesday's big developments.\n\nThen, Ed looked at the real casualties in the fiscal cliff face-off with Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA).\n\nTea Party Rep. Allen West finally conceded and his victorious opponent, Rep.-elect Patrick Murphy (D-FL), joined Ed Tuesday.\n\nRacial code words are part of the attack against U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. Michael Eric Dyson (Professor of Sociology at Georgetown university and author of &quot;Can You Hear Me Now?&quot;), and Karen Finney (MSNBC Political Analyst and Former DNC Communications Director), sounded off on that.\n\nJust two weeks after the election, Scott Walker kicks off the block the vote campaign for 2016. Ed told how the Wisconsin governor wants to make it harder to vote.\n\nAnd in the BIG Finish, Ed talked politics with The Fonz himself! Legendary actor Henry Winkler joined to talk about President Obama's re-election and GOP roadblocks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d61bb80c6c8bf88c3025c491d0414fb8018bb915","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+11-20-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d61bb80c6c8bf88c3025c491d0414fb8018bb915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,27,184,12,108,139,248,140,48,37,196,145,208,65,79,184,1,139,185,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
