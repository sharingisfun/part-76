The new technology was developed by Cynex; a leader in the robotics industry. \n\n\nSpecializing in industrial robotics, Cynex created over the next 3 years Environmental Reconstructing Machines (ERMs or terraforming robots) in hopes of reversing the damage mankind had done to the planet over the years. \n\n\nWhile mankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intentions were noble; the Cynex ERMs calculated mankind was the source of the damage produced on the Earth and began systematically wiping out the human race. 300 years later mankind struggles on the brink of extinction. \n\nOur hero Ryan must fight to survive as the ERMs get closer and closer to completely terraforming Earth.\n\n\nCreated By:\n\nSteven Bredemeyer\nKellan Busch\nTom Hansen\nJames Ratkay\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34bd8053019962f84220fa95ad0c49d315c86cf5","amp;dn":"Bullet+Magnet+-+PC+-+2012+-+Senior+Project","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34bd8053019962f84220fa95ad0c49d315c86cf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,189,128,83,1,153,98,248,66,32,250,149,173,12,73,211,21,200,108,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
