Cooking at Christmas is a wonderful piece of slow-down\n therapy but that doesn't mean that you have to be tied to the stove the entire\n time. Getting ahead and filling the freezer can be the answer to a Christmas prayer.\n\n  After mixing a lychee martini, Nigella cooks roast pumpkin and sweet potato \nsoup with a Stilton swirl, mincemeat pies and her Star from the East, plus a\nlamb and date tagine - all wonderful to eat straight away or to store in the \nfreezer for the arrival of last-minute guests. And if they have any room left,\nNigella's 'girdle buster' pie more than lives up to its reputation.
