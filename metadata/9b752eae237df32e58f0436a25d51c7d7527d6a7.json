It is rather a free adaptation of available subtitles of the movie found on Internet intertwined with subtitles of the 1979 remake of the film by Werner Herzog.\n\nAs the title suggests this subtitle is mainly meant for a certain ritual of watching Nosferatu, which is on a night journey. However, this subtitle is carefully recommended for other nocturnal viewings. *****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b752eae237df32e58f0436a25d51c7d7527d6a7","amp;dn":"NosferatuInFlight%5BEng%5D.srt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b752eae237df32e58f0436a25d51c7d7527d6a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,117,46,174,35,125,243,46,88,240,67,106,37,213,28,125,117,39,214,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
