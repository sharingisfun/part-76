Determinedly, they embark on a daring mission to be the first pigs on Pluto, but things go horribly wrong as soon as the journey begins and they crash land on the moon. Soon they find themselves playing a pivotal role in the moon men's battle to free themselves from the oppression of the American space program! This is an unabashedly fun book, like Star Wars mixed with Pokemon, if you can believe that! Packed with action, adventure, and cute little cuties!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:882ead8ec62de2840c2c1bf1fc0beaad7478132f","amp;dn":"James+Kochalka+-+Pinky+and+Stinky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"882ead8ec62de2840c2c1bf1fc0beaad7478132f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,46,173,142,198,45,226,132,12,44,27,241,252,11,234,173,116,120,19,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
