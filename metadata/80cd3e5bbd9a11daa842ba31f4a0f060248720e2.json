He also translated many books of Abdolkarim Soroush into Arabic.\n\nÃ˜Â¹Ã™â€ Ã˜Â§Ã™Ë†Ã™Å Ã™â€  Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ™â€¦Ã˜Â­Ã˜Â§Ã˜Â¶Ã˜Â±Ã˜Â§Ã˜Âª:\n\nÃ˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â£Ã˜Â®Ã™â€žÃ˜Â§Ã™â€š Ã˜Â¨Ã™Å Ã™â€  Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¯Ã˜Â§Ã™ï¿½Ã˜Â¹ Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ™Ë†Ã˜Â¬Ã˜Â¯Ã˜Â§Ã™â€ Ã™Å  Ã™Ë†Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¯Ã™Å Ã™â€ Ã™Å  \nÃ˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¹Ã˜Â¯Ã™â€ž Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¥Ã™â€žÃ™â€¡Ã™Å  Ã˜Â£Ã˜Â®Ã˜Â±Ã™Ë†Ã™Å  Ã˜Â£Ã™â€¦ Ã˜Â¯Ã™â€ Ã™Å Ã™Ë†Ã™Å  \nÃ˜Â¨Ã™Å Ã™â€  Ã˜Â¯Ã™Å Ã™â€  Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â£Ã˜Â­Ã˜Â±Ã˜Â§Ã˜Â± Ã™Ë†Ã˜Â¯Ã™Å Ã™â€  Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¹Ã˜Â¨Ã™Å Ã˜Â¯  \nÃ˜ÂªÃ˜Â£Ã˜Â«Ã™Å Ã˜Â± Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¥Ã˜Â­Ã˜Â³Ã˜Â§Ã˜Â³ Ã˜Â¨Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¥Ã˜Â«Ã™â€¦ \nÃ˜Â­Ã™â€šÃ™Å Ã™â€šÃ˜Â© Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¯Ã˜Â§Ã˜Â± Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¢Ã˜Â®Ã˜Â±Ã˜Â© \nÃ˜Â­Ã™Ë†Ã˜Â§Ã˜Â± Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¥Ã™Å Ã™â€¦Ã˜Â§Ã™â€  \nÃ™Æ’Ã™Å Ã™ï¿½ Ã™â€ Ã™ï¿½Ã™â€¡Ã™â€¦ Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ™â€šÃ˜Â±Ã˜Â¢Ã™â€  Ã™Ë†Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ™â€ Ã˜Âµ Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¯Ã™Å Ã™â€ Ã™Å \nÃ™Æ’Ã™Å Ã™ï¿½ Ã™â€ Ã™ï¿½Ã™â€¡Ã™â€¦ Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ™â€žÃ™â€¡ \nÃ™â€¦Ã˜Â³Ã˜ÂªÃ˜Â­Ã™Å Ã™â€ž Ã˜Â£Ã™â€  Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ™â€šÃ˜Â±Ã˜Â¢Ã™â€  Ã™â€¦Ã™â€  Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ™â€žÃ™â€¡\nÃ™â€¡Ã™â€ž Ã™â€ Ã˜Â­Ã™â€  Ã˜Â¨Ã˜Â­Ã˜Â§Ã˜Â¬Ã˜Â© Ã˜Â¥Ã™â€žÃ™â€° Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¯Ã™Å Ã™â€ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80cd3e5bbd9a11daa842ba31f4a0f060248720e2","amp;dn":"Ahmed+Al-Gubbanchi+-+Batch+%23+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80cd3e5bbd9a11daa842ba31f4a0f060248720e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,205,62,91,189,154,17,218,168,66,186,49,244,160,240,96,36,135,32,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
