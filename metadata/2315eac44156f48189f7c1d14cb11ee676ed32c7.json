Besides optional keyboard shortcuts to\ntrigger the different modes, there is no fiddling with your\nkeyboard required as most modes simply involve mouse positioning\nand clicking to begin/end the capturing process.\n\nFixed Size Region:\n==================\n\n- Select any application window, including scrolling windows,\nand have Ashampoo Snap 6 capture their entire contents to\nimage files. You may also capture your entire desktop or\napplication menus.\n- Additionally, Ashampoo Snap 6 provides presets for common\nwindow sizes.\n\nFree Size Region:\n=================\n\n- Either use a freely resizable rectangle shape or draw your own\nshape to capture any region of your screen.\n\nTimer;\n======\n\n- Some scenarios require interval capturing, e.g. to record a\nstep-by-step process for a tutorial project. In this mode,\nAshampoo Snap 6 either creates a single screenshot after a\ndefinable time period (10 to 30 seconds) or several at a\ncustomizable interval from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every 5th SecondÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every HourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n- This mode works with the desktop, application windows or a\nfreely resizable rectangle area.\n\nVideo:\n======\n\n- Although Ashampoo Snap 6 already provides timer-based\ncapturing at fixed intervals, some cases require higher\nframerates only possible through video capturing. In Ashampoo\nSnap 6, video and audio codec settings are customizable\nincluding framerate, format and bitrate. Sound recording is\nsupported through any available Windows recording device.\n- Additionally, Ashampoo Snap 6 provides settings to allow for\nmouse cursor effects such as glowing on mouse clicks as well\nas video post processing including effects such as Sepia and\nautomatic resizing.\n- Recording is either done on the fly for faster machines or\nwith disk caching for slower machines.\n- This mode works with the desktop, application windows, freely\nresizable and fixed-size rectangle areas as well as any\navailable webcam.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n====================\n\nWindows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8\n\nGraphic adapter: min.resolution 1024 x 768 and 16-bit High color (32-bit recommended) and min. 64 MB RAM.\n\nSound Card: none (supported audio record device and microphone recommended)\n\nRAM and disk space: 256 MB RAM, approx. 50 MB Hard Disk Space for program files.\n\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
