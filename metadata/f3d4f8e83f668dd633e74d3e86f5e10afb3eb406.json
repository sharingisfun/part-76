Lt. McQuade is a green rookie who is now under the command of the tough Captain and he does not seem to be able to do anything right. Lt. McQuade also has trouble with Tracey, but it will be the renegade Indians that will test him and teach him the importance of following orders.\n\nUser Review\n\nIndians attack settlers. Undermanned cavalry tracks Indians. Indians massacre cavalry. Cavalry massacres Indians.\n\nThis lurid, routine programmer, would be entirely forgettable, except for two extraordinary performances. Richard Boone portrays the Cavalry Commander, with the kind dignity, sensitivity and intensity which only Richard Boone could give. Charles Bronson plays a dirty minded, foul mouthed, but surprisingly noble corporal. For these two performances alone, see the movie.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3d4f8e83f668dd633e74d3e86f5e10afb3eb406","amp;dn":"A+Thunder+of+Drums+%28Western%29+%7BBoone%2C+Bronson%2C+Hamilton%7D+%5B1961%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3d4f8e83f668dd633e74d3e86f5e10afb3eb406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,212,248,232,63,102,141,214,51,231,77,62,134,245,225,10,251,62,180,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
