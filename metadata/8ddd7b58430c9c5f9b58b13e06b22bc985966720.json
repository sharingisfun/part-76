The film takes place during Carnival Time in Rio De Janeiro. As unconfined joy wafts its way through the streets, the lives of several fabulously wealthy visitors and a group of voluptuous stewardesses intersect, sometimes with startling results. Sylvia Koscina and Mylene Demongeot are among the visual delights of this garish romp. Originally released at 125 minutes, The Girl Game (also known as Copacabana Palace and The Saga of the Flying Hostesses) was pared down to 90 minutes for its play-off dates. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nA French/Italian/Brazilian co-production, COPACABANA PALACE / THE GIRL GAME would be an average Euro lighthearted romance-caper film were it not for the Brazilian element in the mixÃ¢â‚¬â€œgreat locations, great music by Jobim and Bonfa, many Brazilian elements throughout the films, and even cameos from Antonio Carlos Jobim, Luis Bonfa, and Joao Gilberto (one of the characters pretends to be talking to Jobim on the phone and makes plans to meet him and his Ã¢â‚¬Å“friendsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Luis and Joao). We even get two songs sung by Norma Bengell! While the film itself is a pleasant time-killer, the bossa nova content makes it a fascinating documentÃ¢â‚¬â€œan artifact from that brief period in the early 1960s when the romanticized Brazil of song and legend was THE place to be, the place to fantasize being. Anyone with any interest in this period should try to find a copy. Fans of dubbed Euro 60s co-productions will also like the film, but what makes it special is the bossa nova content (IMDB)\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 1.36 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 23mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 326 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 2 frames\nCodec ID                                 : H264\nDuration                                 : 1h 23mn\nBit rate                                 : 2 124 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 704 pixels\nHeight                                   : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.40:1\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nScan type                                : Progressive\n\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ddd7b58430c9c5f9b58b13e06b22bc985966720","amp;dn":"Copacaban+Palace+%281962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ddd7b58430c9c5f9b58b13e06b22bc985966720","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,221,123,88,67,12,156,95,155,88,177,62,6,178,43,201,133,150,103,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
