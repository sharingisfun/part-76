There is too much knowledge and discoveries being swept under the carpet in particular by the Smithsonian Institute and anyone can do a search of this and find numerous instances where they have either ridiculed genuine finds and evidence or those that couldn't be dumbed down in this way were apparently lost when enquiries were made about these finds by eminent archaeologists.\nThe Smithsonian Institute are very keen to hide many discoveries as it would mean all the books would have to be rewritten and they are very much aware of this - it would also mean academia had it wrong (we can't have that can we) and they refuse to simply acknowledge that the nature of archaeology is such that as we make new discoveries we need to update with reference to new findings.\nBut hey, new findings may mean new understandings of who we are and new insights that will have intelligent investigation treating where they don't want you to tread.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.
