The series featured mixes of human and funny animal material. The series was edited by Steven Douglas with George L. Carlson as principal artist.\n\nGeorge L. Carlson was in his mid-fifties and a veteran childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book illustrator and puzzle maker when he took on Jingle Jangle Comics. His experience included painting the first edition dust jacket for Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind and ghosting the newspaper strip RegÃ¢â‚¬â„¢lar Fellas for artist Gene Byrnes. He had previously published Jingle Jangle Tales as a childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book and an unsuccessful Sunday newspaper page. Each issue of the comic book contained at least one of his two features (and many contained both): &quot;Jingle Jangle Tales&quot; and &quot;The Pie-Face Prince&quot;. Carlson completed every aspect of his features himself Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pencils, inks, etc. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ earning $25 per page for the twelve pages he produced for each issue.\n\nCarlsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sophisticated Jingle Jangle fairy tales mixed burlesque, fantasy, and wordplay with his own brand of nonsense in multi-layered features of visual and verbal harmony. Characters in his work included The Youthful Yodeler, the Half-Champion Archer, the Very Horseless Jockey, King Hokum of Pretzleburg and his son the pie-face Prince Dimwitri, the Princess Panetella Murphy (DimwitriÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs love), the Raging Raja (DimwitriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite enemy), and the Wicked Green Witch. DimwitriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventures were many and varied: in one tale, he went aloft in an 18-carat balloon in search of a missing bass drum and in another he searched for the Doopsniggle Prize with his corned-beef flavored cabbage plant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98d7d398c000b8633f151c2af7090333926b0e2b","amp;dn":"George+Carlson%3A+Jingle+Jangle+Comics.+39+issues+%28Eastern+Color%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98d7d398c000b8633f151c2af7090333926b0e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,215,211,152,192,0,184,99,63,21,28,42,247,9,3,51,146,107,14,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
