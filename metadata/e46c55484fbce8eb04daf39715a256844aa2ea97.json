More than a collection of thoughts for the day, Comfortable with Uncertainty offers a progressive program of spiritual study, leading the reader through essential concepts, themes, and practices on the Buddhist path.\n\n\n\nComfortable with Uncertainty does not assume prior knowledge of Buddhist thought or practice, making it a perfect introduction to Pema ChÃƒÂ¶drÃƒÂ¶nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teachings on lovingkindness, meditation, mindfulness, Ã¢â‚¬Å“nowness,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ letting go, and working with fear and other painful emotions. Through the course of this book, readers will learn practical methods for heightening awareness and overcoming habitual patterns that block compassion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e46c55484fbce8eb04daf39715a256844aa2ea97","amp;dn":"Comfortable+with+Uncertainty%3A+108+Teachings+on+Cultivating+Fearl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e46c55484fbce8eb04daf39715a256844aa2ea97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,108,85,72,79,188,232,235,4,218,243,151,21,162,86,132,74,162,234,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
