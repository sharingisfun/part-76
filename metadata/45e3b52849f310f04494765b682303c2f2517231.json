Other 3.55 games not working, esp DUPLEX ones?\n\nThis fully automatic program will fix it!! just drag the .pkg file onto the .bat file and the program does all the work extracting, resigning and repacking.\n\nI tested it on Final Fight and some others.. works 100%.\n\n----------------------\n\n\nFollowing up on my previous update, today I decided to take my PS3 Resigner Script even further and came up with something I'm very excited about - I present to you CFW 4.xx+ F.A.R. Script v0.5b (F.A.R. standing for &quot;Full Auto Resigner&quot; ^^).\n\nDownload: PS3 CFW 4.XX+ F.A.R. (Full Auto Resigner) Script v0.5b\n\nChanges since previous Resigner Script:\n\n    \nAutomatically unpacks, resigns, finds/adds &quot;Content and Title ID&quot; to package.conf and repacks .pkg files (Just drag and drop your .pkg file on the &quot;CFW 4.xx+F.A.R. Script (Drag Here).bat&quot;)\n    \n\nAutomatically detects if the input file is an EBOOT.BIN and is able resign DISC and NPDRM EBOOT.BIN's (Drag and drop the EBOOT.BIN on the .bat and select DISC or NPDRM at the prompt)\n    \n\nAutomatically makes a .BAK (backup) of your original EBOOT in it's source folder.\n\n\nHope you enjoy it\n\nFor questions and bug reports don't hesitate to contact me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45e3b52849f310f04494765b682303c2f2517231","amp;dn":"CFW_4.xx__F.A.R._Script_v0.5b.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45e3b52849f310f04494765b682303c2f2517231","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,227,181,40,73,243,16,240,68,148,118,91,104,35,3,194,242,81,114,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
