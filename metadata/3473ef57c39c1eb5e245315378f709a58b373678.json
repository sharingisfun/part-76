Hugh is a fisherman with a special relationship to the sea, a relationship based on respect and reverence. But when Hugh feels that the sea has betrayed him, his whole existence is thrown out of whack. Hell-bent on settling the score, Hugh takes his revenge to the extreme, jeopardizing not only himself, but also his family in the process. That Salty Air is a story about change and learning the price for trifling with the natural progression of things.\n\nThanks goes to Empire for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3473ef57c39c1eb5e245315378f709a58b373678","amp;dn":"That+Salty+Air+%282012%29+%28digital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3473ef57c39c1eb5e245315378f709a58b373678","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,115,239,87,195,156,30,181,226,69,49,83,120,247,9,165,139,55,54,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
