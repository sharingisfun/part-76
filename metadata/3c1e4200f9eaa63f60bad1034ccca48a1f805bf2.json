On todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worldwide broadcast, Alex talks with constitutional lawyer and the former associate deputy attorney general in the Reagan administration, Bruce Fein, and also retired CIA officer turned activist and journalist Ray McGovern about war in the Middle East and Israel's latest actions in Gaza. \n\nAlex talks with Prison Planet.com editor and journalist Paul Joseph Watson about &quot;Opt Out Week.&quot;\n\nAs seems to be the rule now, when Alex has a sponsor or a business partner on as a guest, they are not mentioned in the official show description. Today for 45 minutes of hour three and the entirety of a full fourth hour, Alex talks with Joel Wallach -- veterinarian, naturopath and founder of Youngevity (the products Alex sells at InfowarsTeam.com).\nAn hour after the end of the broadcast the podcast file for the 4th hour is not available from GCN. I will post it on my blog once it is available. You're not missing much; it's basically a one hour commercial for Youngevity.\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c1e4200f9eaa63f60bad1034ccca48a1f805bf2","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2012+Nov+19+MO+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c1e4200f9eaa63f60bad1034ccca48a1f805bf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,30,66,0,249,234,166,63,96,186,209,3,76,204,164,138,31,128,91,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
