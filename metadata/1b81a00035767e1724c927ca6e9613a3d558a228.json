In this epic adventure from J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions and &quot;Supernatural's&quot; Eric Kripke, a family struggles to reunite in an American landscape where every single piece of technology - computers, planes, cars, phones, even lights - has mysteriously blacked out forever. A drama with sweeping scope and intimate focus, &quot;Revolution&quot; is also about family - both the family you're born into and the family you choose. This is a swashbuckling journey of hope and rebirth seen through the eyes of one strong-willed young woman, Charlie Matheson (Tracy Spiridakos, &quot;Being Human&quot;), and her brother Danny (Graham Rogers, &quot;Memphis Beat&quot;). When Danny is kidnapped by militia leaders for a darker purpose, Charlie must reconnect with her estranged uncle Miles (Billy Burke, &quot;The Twilight Saga&quot;), a former U.S. Marine living a reclusive life. Together, with a rogue band of survivors, they set out to rescue Danny, overthrow the militia and ultimately re-establish the United States of America. All the while, they explore the enduring mystery of why the power failed, and if - or how - it will ever return.\n\n[img]http://i298.photobucket.com/albums/mm256/IceHappy/Please%20Seed/SeedTheWorldPleaseSeedasLongasPossible.gif[/img]\n\n[b][color=red]Video[/color][/b]\nFormat : MPEG-4 at 2 816 Kbps\nLength : 866 MiB for 43mn 0s 11ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 2 494 Kbps\nAspect : 1920 x 1080 (1.778) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AAC at 317 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : en","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b81a00035767e1724c927ca6e9613a3d558a228","amp;dn":"Revolution+S01E17+1080+HDTV+%7BKNIX%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b81a00035767e1724c927ca6e9613a3d558a228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,129,160,0,53,118,126,23,36,201,39,202,110,150,19,163,213,88,162,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
