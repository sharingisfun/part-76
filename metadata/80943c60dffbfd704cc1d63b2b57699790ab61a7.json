Along the way, he encounters elephants who can talk to each other through solid rock; seals who use their whiskers to sense the shape, size, speed and direction of an object that passed over thirty seconds earlier; and a blind cyclist who relies on fruit bats to get him safely down a twisting mountain bike trail.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80943c60dffbfd704cc1d63b2b57699790ab61a7","amp;dn":"Richard+Hammond%27s+Miracles+of+Nature+S01E02+-+Super-Senses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80943c60dffbfd704cc1d63b2b57699790ab61a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,148,60,96,223,251,253,112,76,193,214,59,43,87,105,151,144,171,97,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
