Jasper, senior editor of The New American, joins Alex to expose the impending destruction of American national sovereignty under the guise of Trans-Atlantic U.S./EU &quot;trade agreements.&quot; \n\nSSG Joe Biggs, close friend of Michael Hastings, delivers more bombshell revelations regarding the obvious assassination of the Rolling Stone journalist.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to\n share information that counters the monotone of mainstream\n corporate media. \n\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.
