During the Middle Ages these fortified structures were the ultimate authority in any region they were built. Both defensive and offensive, they were centres of administration, symbols of power as well as concentrations of military might. But what was it that made each successful? Through dynamic location footage and immersive visual effects, this six episode series reveals the bloody history behind these fortifications and the weapons designed to defeat them. Each episode will climax with the ultimate test of each castle's strength: examining the epic battle that changed the course of history.\n\n\n\n4)  Conwy Castle \nPositioned the wilds of northern Wales, Conwy Castle was one of several strongholds raised by King Edward I to rule over the Welsh. Its mighty towers, elongated arrow slits and majestic water gate were built to intimidate. In 1294, a rebel force arrives to put the king's castles, and English domination, to the ultimate test. Would the welsh force headed by Madog ap Llewelyn, the last recognised native Prince of Wales succeed in taking the castle?\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8581/battlecastlescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8581/battlecastlescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2460/battlecastlescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2460/battlecastlescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/9826/battlecastlescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/9826/battlecastlescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/23/battlecastlescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/23/battlecastlescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6648/battlecastlescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6648/battlecastlescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/989/battlecastlescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/989/battlecastlescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/6854/battlecastlescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/6854/battlecastlescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4091/battlecastlescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4091/battlecastlescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2690/battlecastlescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2690/battlecastlescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2092 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 44mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size:701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://battlecastle.tv/?meta=home#series&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://battlecastle.tv/?meta=home#series&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfd40420235b730e6fcf886e89abcb8154191791","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Battle+Castle+with+Dan+Snow+4of6+Conwy+Castle+PDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfd40420235b730e6fcf886e89abcb8154191791","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,212,4,32,35,91,115,14,111,207,136,110,137,171,203,129,84,25,23,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
