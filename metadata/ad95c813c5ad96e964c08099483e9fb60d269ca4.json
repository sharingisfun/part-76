Surprisingly it shows a DVD was released in 2011 of this little known film.\n\nStoryline \n\nBasically another Indian vs Calvary war movie same plots went a lot of action, filmed in black/white\n\nUser Review\n\nThis is pretty standard cavalry outpost versus the Apaches fare, but it's well acted and directed, moves along at a good clip and boasts an intelligent script that develops its stock characters effectively. Robert Taylor is at his best in this kind of stalwart but human role. And the rest of the cast delivers strongly. (Arlene Dahl has great chemistry with both Taylor and John Hodiak, rivals for her affections.)\n\nThis was director Sam Wood's last film. The many action scenes are well staged and exciting, although color would have enhanced them. This is an example of big-budget Hollywood westerns from the late 40's and early 50's (many better known than this, e.g., &quot;Red River) which--for some reason--were filmed in black and white.\n3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad95c813c5ad96e964c08099483e9fb60d269ca4","amp;dn":"Ambush+%28Western%29+%7BRobert+Taylor%2C+John+Hodiak%7D+%5B1950%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad95c813c5ad96e964c08099483e9fb60d269ca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,149,200,19,197,173,150,233,100,192,128,153,72,62,159,182,13,38,156,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
