Daniel is a perpetually hard up writer and expert on Coptic art. He meets Canadian student Tara who asks him to take a letter to a senior politician whose son Daniel tutors in English. The politician is angered and orders Daniel not to return, but Daniel is aware that a significant sum of money is available for successful completion of his task. He thus weaves a story to Tara, but matters spiral out of his control. Who is double crossing whom?\n\nThe on air audio bonkfest could win the bad radio sex award and sits ill with the rest of the programme, but just laugh at or ignore this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3f4084c23e799e094e95252948e6f2ac88baabd","amp;dn":"The+Reluctant+Spy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3f4084c23e799e094e95252948e6f2ac88baabd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,244,8,76,35,231,153,224,148,233,82,82,148,142,111,42,200,139,170,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
