CRUSH sounds simple: Keep the blocks from filling the screen by removing matching colors with a single touch. But the blocks keep coming, and each touch boosts the stack even higher. CRUSH brings you three modes of exciting short-burst puzzle gameplay:\n\nTHINK mode: Take a little time and consider what moves to make. Go for massive combos to rack up the best Block score.\n\nREACT mode: Make moves quickly to keep stack low. Survive as long as possible.\n\nCRUSH mode: The ultimate combination of speed and strategy. Go for both large combos and a long survival time.\n\nChoose from 6 recharging powers to use as you please, with each slightly changing the strategy required to achieve maximum scores. The powers also provide a shield against an untimely death, but are destroyed in the process.\n\nCRUSH also lets you select from 3 background color schemes to suit your needs.\n\nCRUSH includes an innovative 4-way UI system and a minimalist art-style inspired by Propellerhead Software (Figure, Reason, Rebirth).\n\nWhat's in this version:\n\n1.05 (minor)\nActivated Inferno+ in More Games section\n1.04 (minor)\nActivated Ballistic SE in the More Games section\nSwitched how the back button works on the confirm exit dialog\n1.03 (minor)\nUpdate icon, added tablet text, and added HOW TO PLAY text to description\n1.02\nAdded Help text in options menu.\nActivated Bombcats in games list.\n1.01\nNew startup graphic (matches Fireball and Slydris)\nAdd Fireball to games list.\n\nMore info:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radiangames.crush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radiangames.crush&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b5ccea66e435c82e324cdb98d59ee20e70d2f20","amp;dn":"CRUSH+v1.05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b5ccea66e435c82e324cdb98d59ee20e70d2f20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,92,206,166,110,67,92,130,227,36,205,185,141,89,238,32,231,13,47,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
