But the screen was not centered!\n\nMost of the times you had to search for a specific patch.\nNo any more, I hope!\n\nSupport ISO and BIN CD/DVD PS2 images and single ELF files as well.\n!!!!!!!! NEW: Now you have the option to build a P/N Selector !!!!!!!!!\n\nAttention:\n\tCase 1) This program will modify the ELF file.\n\t\tBACKUP THE ELF FILE FIRST, PLEASE.\n\tCase 2) For CD/DVD PS2 images the ELF file is backuped automatically.\n\n\nUSAGE:\n\tClick on 'Browse' and then choose an ELF file or a CD/DVD PS2 image.\n\tCheck the 'MAKE PN SELECTOR' Box for building a P/N selector. Otherwise, uncheck it.\n\tClick on 'Patch File' and read the text output.\n\tAFTER BURN, please report the result at http://www.nofuzz.com/ktd.\n\t\n\tNEW: if the patching did not work you can restore the ELF file \nof the PS2 CD/DVD image with the backuped one.\n\tClick on 'Browse' and then choose the CD/DVD PS2 image.\n\tClick on 'RESTORE' and select the backup ELF.\n\n\nThe program will first try to change the video mode from NTSC to PAL.\nIt will indicate you if found any locations to patch, if the ELF is \nalready patched and the number of locations to patch.\nThen it will try to patch the screen Y position. It will indicate you if\ncan not find any patch locations or if can not patch the locations found.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:230ee67dd490dee2b06170ac09598d32397836be","amp;dn":"%5BPS2%5D+NTSC+2+PAL+with+YFIX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"230ee67dd490dee2b06170ac09598d32397836be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,14,230,125,212,144,222,226,176,97,112,172,9,89,141,50,57,120,54,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
