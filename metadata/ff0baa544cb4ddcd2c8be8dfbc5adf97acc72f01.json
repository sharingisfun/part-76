In the nineteenth and yearly twentieth centuries the Scottish exodus reached truly unprecedented proportions. Yet this was also an era of remarkable material and social transformation in Scotland as the nation became one of the most prosperous on earth during the Victorian decades. Why then were so many Scots leaving the country of their birth to make new lives in the New World at a rate only paralleled by emigration from some of Europe's poorest countries? This lecture will confront this intriguing and challenging puzzle and comes up with some surprising answers.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0a42636d624a4639243b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 18.5\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: 125 Kbps ABR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 58mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 620 MB\nSource: WebRip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff0baa544cb4ddcd2c8be8dfbc5adf97acc72f01","amp;dn":"BBC+The+RSE+Christmas+Lecture+2011+To+the+Ends+of+the+Earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff0baa544cb4ddcd2c8be8dfbc5adf97acc72f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,11,170,84,76,180,221,205,44,139,232,223,188,90,223,151,172,199,47,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
