He escapes and although he is not welcome, he warns the few townsmen not away on cattle drives. Two years ago he had to kill two of the Morrisons. When the remaining two Morrisons come after him he kills them and just before the Spangler gang attacks and his gun will be needed, he is jailed. \n\nUser Review\n\nThis is the third time this story by Steve Fisher has been done. The first time was &quot;Top Gun&quot; starring Sterling Hayden done in 1955 in black and white, and then done again as &quot;Noose for a Gunman&quot; in 1960 starring Jim Davis, who later became Jock Ewing on &quot;Dallas&quot; (Ted DeCorsia even played the same role as in &quot;The Quick Gun&quot; with John Dehner taking the main villain role in &quot;Top Gun&quot;). All three are good if you like the old fashion type westerns, which I do. They were simple, your kids and grandkids could watch them, and they always had a good ending. Need more of them today. To me, Audie Murphy will always be a hero on the battlefield (The most decorated soldier in WWII including the medal of honor)and on the screen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1736d5f4bee5434bb3a89dc4febc9c4cf0e21cb4","amp;dn":"Quick+Gun%2C+The+%7BWestern%29+%7BMurphy%2C+Anders%2C+Best%7D+%5B1964%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1736d5f4bee5434bb3a89dc4febc9c4cf0e21cb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,54,213,244,190,229,67,75,179,168,157,196,254,188,156,76,240,226,28,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
