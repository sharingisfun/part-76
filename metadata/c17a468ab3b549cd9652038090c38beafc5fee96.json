And it's available just days before the debut of the Broadway musical based on the original story of little '40s-era Ralphie and his Christmastime woes.\nThe film sequel follows Ralphie as a teenager. He no longer yearns for a Red Ryder BB gun, but now wants a 1938 Hupmobile Skyline Convertible. There are a few things that haven't changed: Triple dog dares, and the fact that the old man -- Ralphie's dad -- is still obsessed with that fishnet-stocking-adorned leg lamp.\n&quot;A Christmas Story 2&quot; stars Daniel Stern (&quot;Home Alone,&quot; &quot;City Slickers&quot;) as the crotchety, lighting fixture-fixated dad, and Ralphie is played by accomplished child actor Braeden Lemasters (&quot;Men of a Certain Age,&quot; &quot;Easy A&quot;).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c17a468ab3b549cd9652038090c38beafc5fee96","amp;dn":"A+Christmas+Story+2+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c17a468ab3b549cd9652038090c38beafc5fee96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,122,70,138,179,181,73,205,150,82,3,128,144,195,139,234,252,95,238,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
