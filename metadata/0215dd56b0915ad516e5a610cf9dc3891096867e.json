Pirates Uploading is fun and makes good Karma! I have s.o0 many hours of enjoyment from the Pirates Bay, it's time to give back. This is torrent # 3 for this SeattleBeach. Who knows at this rate maybe I'll get a skull in a year or 2! I still don't have a single comment on any of my uploads, so I hope they are treating you all well.\n \nBy the way Pirates how do I upload more than just a movie file, you like an info sheet, art work, sample??? Hit me up if you got a clue! If not maybe I'll ask Google and get a answer!\n\n \n Enough chatter on to the main event Today's feature is 'King Kelly' I must say I picked up for Miss Krause not expecting much more than a little T &amp; A, but I was pleasantly surprised at a pretty descent  film. So without further ado, I present:  \n\nKING KELLY in 720p HD and Dolby Digital 2.0.\n\n\nStars: Louisa Krause, Libby Woodbridge, Roderick Hill\n\n\nStoryline: King Kelly is an aspiring internet star who performs webcam stripteases. When Kelly's car - filled with illegal narcotics that she must deliver - is stolen by her bitter ex-boyfriend on the 4th of July, Kelly and her best friend Jordan embark on an epic whirlwind of drugs, sex, violence and mischief-making as Kelly tries to reclaim what's hers. Kelly's biggest online fan, a wayward State Trooper, joins the journey as the night spirals into chaos. Made entirely from camera-phone footage, King Kelly is a sensational journey through hedonistic American youth culture and the YouTube generation.\nCompatibility: Works on my Sammie 46&quot; 7100 Series 3D 1080p LED HDTV. I just hook WD Passport  hard drive up to the USB connection {on the input panel} and it works. I personally run it through my Sammie Blu Ray player {through the front USB port} so I get to use my Onyko TX-SR875 Audio/Video Processor for better sound and picture. Plug and Play no conversion necessary!\nPlays With: WMP, PowerDVD, Nero Kwik Media, QuickTime. haven't tried any others but doesn't seem to have any problems playing on whatever I open it with it's .mp4 should play on most anything.\n\n\nUnrated: But I can say It has: BooBs!, drugs, Adult  Situations, and harsh language; so a hard &quot;R&quot; is what I'd call it.\n \nDuration: 1 hr. 24 min.\n\n\n\nStay Thirsty my Friends!\n\n&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¿Ã¢â‚¬Â¿Ã¢â€”â€¢ SeattleBeach .Ã¯Â½Â¡oO\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0215dd56b0915ad516e5a610cf9dc3891096867e","amp;dn":"King+Kelly+%5B2012%5D+720p+DD+2.0++%7BNo+one+will+believe+me+when+I+po","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0215dd56b0915ad516e5a610cf9dc3891096867e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,21,221,86,176,145,90,213,22,229,166,16,207,157,195,137,16,150,134,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
