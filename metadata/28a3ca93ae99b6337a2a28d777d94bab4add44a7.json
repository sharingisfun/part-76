Recorded with producer Glyn Johns, Ashes &amp; Fire marks Adams' return to recording following the disbandment of backing band the Cardinals in 2009. Regarding the album, Adams noted, &quot;The record is obsessed with time. I believe that there is a kinder view of the self. I'm passing through my own life as a ghost, and looking at these pieces and places in my life. I'm looking at California, and the idea of being lost and found at the same time.&quot;\n\n1.\tDirty Rain\n2.\tAshes &amp; Fire\n3.\tCome Home\n4.\tRocks\n5.\tDo I Wait\n6.\tChains of Love\n7.\tInvisible Riverside\n8.\tSave Me\n9.\tKindness\n10.\tLucky Now\n11.\tI Love You but I Don't Know What to Say\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28a3ca93ae99b6337a2a28d777d94bab4add44a7","amp;dn":"Ryan+Adams+-+ASHES+%26amp%3B+FIRE+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28a3ca93ae99b6337a2a28d777d94bab4add44a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,163,202,147,174,153,182,51,122,42,40,215,119,217,75,171,74,221,68,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
