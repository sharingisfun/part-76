It's listenable, but expect mediocre sound and some tape hiss.\n\nAs an extra added attraction, I've added the Animals' live version of &quot;Paint It Black&quot; ripped from the VHS tape of &quot;Monterey Pop.&quot;\n\nThe tracks are:\n\nRiver Deep, Mountain High\nSan Franciscan Nights\nYear of the Guru\nAnything\nMonterey\nWhite Houses\nWinds of Change\nTo Love Somebody\nSky Pilot\nPaint It Black (from the VHS tape of &quot;Monterey Pop.&quot;\n\nAnother tape from my 600+ tape collection, about a third pre-recorded, the rest made from LPs borrowed from the public library, friends and relatives. &quot;Why cassettes?&quot; I hear you cry. Well, I'm just an analog guy in a digital world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7a5d7232d4624c2731505db0047f1ebf11b1734","amp;dn":"Greatest+Hits+of+Eric+Burdon+and+the+Animals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7a5d7232d4624c2731505db0047f1ebf11b1734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,165,215,35,45,70,36,194,115,21,5,219,0,71,241,235,241,27,23,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
