It introduced new readers to the work of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and other Marvel creators, and packaged the material in a traditional book format that carried more cache than the flimsy pamphlet style of a typical comic book. Many of the books featured painted covers illustrated by such artists as Bob Larkin, John Romita, Sr., and Earl Norem. In this way, the series was an antecedent to the now common practice of packaging &quot;classic&quot; stories into archival editions and trade paperback collections including Marvel's 1998 book Grandson of Origins of Marvel Comics.\n\n------\n\nAlso from Wikipedia:\n\n&quot;Spidey Super Stories&quot; is a live-action, recurring skit on the PBS children's television series The Electric Company. Episodes featured the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, provided to the Children's Television Workshop free of charge, and was played (always in costume) by puppeteer and dancer Danny Seagren. It premiered during the premiere of The Electric Company's fourth (1974Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1975) season, show 391.\n\n[...]\n\nFrom 1974 to 1982, Marvel Comics published a comic book called Spidey Super Stories, which was aimed at children ages 6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10. A total of 57 issues were produced, written by Jim Salicrup. During the early years, a comic book version of one of The Electric Company Spidey skits was included. A truncated version also appeared in The Electric Company Magazine. In contrast to the live-action segments on The Electric Company, Spidey often appeared out of costume as Peter Parker.\n\nEvery issue of Spidey Super Stories featured at least one story where Spidey would team up with an established Marvel Comics superhero and/or fight an established Marvel villain. This served to introduce other Marvel characters to new readers who were unfamiliar with the company's characters prior to seeing Spider-Man on The Electric Company. Most of these stories would feature quick origins, usually taking up a single page or less, of both the featured hero and villain. Guest heroes included Iron Man (on several occasions), Captain America, Doctor Strange, Spider-Woman, Nova, and Ms. Marvel. Guest villains included the Green Goblin, the Blizzard, Jack O'Lantern, and even Thanos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02792d93764983b7ea9523e9e496e9f9962a82ed","amp;dn":"THE+BEST+OF+SPIDEY+SUPER+STORIES+%281978%29+Fireside+Trade+Paperback","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02792d93764983b7ea9523e9e496e9f9962a82ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,121,45,147,118,73,131,183,234,149,35,233,228,150,233,249,150,42,130,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
