I ran them through some filters to clean them up as much as was possible. The other seasons had standard-quality XviD.avi sources.\n...I will upload the New Rules &amp; closing monologue segments for additional seasons at the end of each season's broadcast schedule (provided they are capped).  ;) \n\n\nPlease note, my bandwidth is limited. INITIAL SEEDING WILL AVERAGE BETWEEN 50 &amp; 80 kB/s. Please be patient, and please help seed this rarity. Many thanks are owed to the original cappers/encoders/uploaders of the full episodes, without whom this torrent would not have been possible. Enjoy!  ;) \n\n\nFiles in this torrent:\nNew Rules &amp; Closing Monologue Segments (Real Time with Bill Maher)\n...Season 01\n......1x01 - (02-21-2003).avi\n.........through...\n......1x20 - (09-26-2003).avi\n...Season 02\n......2x01 - (01-16-2004).avi\n.........through...\n......2x23 - (11-05-2004).avi\n...Season 03\n......3x01 - (02-18-2005).avi\n.........through...\n......3x23 - (11-04-2005).avi\n...Season 04\n......4x01 - (02-17-2006).avi\n.........through...\n......4x24 - (11-17-2006).avi\n...Season 05\n......5x01 - (02-16-2007).avi\n.........through...\n......5x24 - (11-02-2007).avi\n...Season 06\n......6x01 - (01-11-2008) [WGA strike, no segments].txt\n......6x02 - (01-18-2008) [WGA strike, no segments].txt\n......6x03 - (01-25-2008) [WGA strike, no segments].txt\n......6x04 - (02-01-2008) [WGA strike, no segments].txt\n......6x05 - (02-08-2008) [WGA strike, no segments].txt\n......6x06 - (02-15-2008).avi\n.........through...\n......6x27 - (11-14-2008).avi\n...Season 07\n......7x01 - (02-20-2009).avi\n.........through...\n......7x31 - (10-16-2009).avi\n...Season 08\n......8x01 - (02-19-2010).avi\n.........through...\n......8x25 - (11-12-2010).avi\n...Season 09\n......9x01 - (01-14-2011).avi\n.........through...\n......9x35 - (11-11-2011).avi\n...Season 10\n......10x01 - (01-13-2012).avi\n.........through...\n......10x34 - (11-16-2012).avi\n...Extras\n......'New Rules, Polite Musings from a Timid Observer' (2005 by Bill Maher) [unabridged audiobook]\n......'The New New Rules, A Funny Look at How Everybody But Me Has Their Head Up Their Ass' (2012 by Bill Maher) [unabridged audiobook]\n......Closing Monologue of 'Bill Maher's Religulous' (2008).avi\n......MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch - Bill Maher vs. Conan O'Brien (04-25-2002) [claymation].avi\n......Sarah on Real Time (The Sarah Silverman Program, 3x02, 02-11-2010).avi\n......Boondocky Real Time (The Boondocks, 3x01, 05-02-2010).avi\n......Brian Griffin on Real Time (Family Guy, 9x06, 11-21-2010).avi\n...Images\n...Info.txt\n\n\n(Complaints about torrent size will be ignored.
