There it gave a performance of Shostakovitch's Symphony No. 5 that drew tumultuous ovations from both the public and critics. Shortly after returning in triumph, Bernstein and the orchestra recorded the work for Columbia's Masterworks label. More than 50 years later is it still consider by many to be the definitive performance of this forceful yet poignant work. Some years later, Bernstein again recorded the piece with the orchestra, to less effect. This is a digital version of an analogue 4-track stereo tape produced by Columbia in the 1960s.
