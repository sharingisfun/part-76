Unbeknownst to the contestants, the game's host has struck a deal with the soldiers hired to guard the money, and does not really have the player's best interests, or even basic safety, at heart. Adding to the situation is a killer hurricane bearing down on the island. Who will walk away with the jackpot? Who will walk away at all?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c6387b38281abb5a6cb3dff9ce8fcb966b86e21","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+Gale+Force%2C+with+Michael+Dudikoff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c6387b38281abb5a6cb3dff9ce8fcb966b86e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,99,135,179,130,129,171,181,166,203,61,255,156,232,252,185,102,184,110,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
