With new footage shot with hi-definition cameras, this award-winning production also features an amazing explosion segment that must be seen with 3D glasses to truly take in its full impact.\n\nOn July 16, 1945, at a site called Trinity, a plutonium bomb was assembled and brought to the top of a tower. The bomb was detonated, producing an intense flash and a fireball that expanded to 600 meters in two seconds. The explosive power was equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. It grew to a height of more than 12 kilometers, boiling up in the shape of a mushroom. Forty seconds later, the blast of air from the bomb reached the observation bunkers, along with a long and deafening roar of sound. And so began the ATOMIC AGE...\n\nIncludes interview with Dr. Edward Teller a developer of nuclear weapons and one of the most controversial figures of the 20th century.\nIncludes de-classified atomic test footage.\n\nDirector: Peter Kuran\nWriters: Scott Narrie, Don Pugsley\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114728/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114728/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f0d5b6213edd17d2f90168b8059e4b5ec6e171c","amp;dn":"Trinity+and+Beyond+-+The+Atomic+Bomb+Movie+%5B1080p%5D%5B5.1%5D%5BEN%5D%5BCBRN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f0d5b6213edd17d2f90168b8059e4b5ec6e171c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,13,91,98,19,237,209,125,47,144,22,139,128,89,228,181,236,110,23,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
