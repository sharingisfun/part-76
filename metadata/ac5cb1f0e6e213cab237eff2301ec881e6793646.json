Here, Lord Mountbatten narrates his life story using a wealth of historical material from the archives of the world - including much from his own personal collection. This extraordinary 12 episode series spans 70 years of triumph, conflict and glory in the life of this remarkable man who rose to worldwide recognition as both statesman and military hero, yet was tragically assassinated in 1979. It is this tremendous sweep of international events and changes that has been recaptured in ths unique series. Unique because it is not only about, but with the man concerned. The production team, including Lord Mountbatten, revisited many of the locales in which his career was formed - Malta, Burma, Ceylon, Singapore, India. Excerpts have been incuded from many of those whose lives and duties infuenced those of Lord Mountbatten, or were influenced by him. They include the Duke of Windsor, Prince Philip, six former Prime Ministers, General Eisenhower and other key figures in world history. \n\nA Television History by John Terraine\nProduced and Directed by Peter Morley\nNarration spoken by Alec Mango\nA Rediffusion Television Production\n\n\n\n\n10)  Fresh Fields \nThe years 1947-1955.\n\nMountbatten is sworn in as India's first Governor General and is immediately faced with the severe problems caused by partition. Nehru's government elects him as chairman of an emergency committee to tackle the worsening situation, which eventually improves, but the failure to accede of three states, Kashmir in particular, causes a permanent problem. In November 1947, Mountbatten returns to England for the marriage of his nephew Philip to Princess Elizabeth. Back in India he attends the funeral of Gandhi after his assassination by a Hindu fanatic, and in June 1948 he hands over as Governor General to Rajaji Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and returns to a somewhat hostile England. Mountbatten returns to the Navy in Malta under the command of some of his former juniors, and sets about climbing the ladder to First Lord, via Vice Admiral, 1949; 4th Sea Lord, 1950; Commander in Chief, Mediterranean, 1952; and Commander in Chief, Allied forces, Mediterranean in 1953.
