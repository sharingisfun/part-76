In that sense, such tracks as the atmospheric Phil Spector-ish number &quot;The Other Side,&quot; the lead single &quot;Grand Opinion,&quot; and the mellow country-rock anthem &quot;Fortunate Family Tree&quot; deliver on AM's knack for quirky '60s pop-inspired songs. Similarly, the duet with Angela Correa, &quot;It's Been so Long,&quot; is pleasantly reminiscent of the classic Lee Hazlewood/Nancy Sinatra pairings. Fans of introspective, classicist pop with more than a bit of wit and charm should find much to enjoy on 'Future Sons &amp; Daughters'. \n\nAM brings a heady brew of twinkling Anglified folk-rock-pop, twanging Americana, caressing Philly soul and funky R&amp;B whatchacallit -- and, best of all, joyously unheard points in-between. With, arguably, some of the best bridges and choruses in the business, drawing from The Beatles and Badfinger or Curtis Mayfield and Jorge Ben.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47e7ed96cfceb664749b6eafd22f9ca7742cde3d","amp;dn":"AM+-+Future+Sons+%26amp%3B+Daughters+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47e7ed96cfceb664749b6eafd22f9ca7742cde3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,231,237,150,207,206,182,100,116,155,110,175,210,47,156,167,116,44,222,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
