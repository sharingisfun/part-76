The show was aired on The History Channel in both the U.K. and U.S. In the U.S. the show was included as part of the 154 episode run of History's Mysteries. During the hour long show, two episodes of Infamous Murders were presented together.\n\nEach episode was thirty minutes long. Three crimes that share a common theme such as motive, means, or victims are given ten minutes of time apiece. The series concentrated on notorious murders carried out during the 20th century. In the beginning of each show a particularly infamous crime would be examined as an example. The words Ã¢â‚¬Å“Infamous Murders now examinesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ would follow and the other three murders would be presented.\n\nThe series relied on historical documents for visuals rather than reenactments. Dramatic music was used to heighten the narration along with rostrum shots of photographs, and vintage television/film footage.\n\nReruns of the show could be seen on The History Channel, the Crime &amp; Investigation Network, Biography Channel, and History International. After History International became H2 in 2011, the rights to the series were discontinued.\n\nA 17 disc DVD version of the series was released in the U.K. as Ultimate Crimes: The WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Most Infamous Murders by Odeon Entertainment in 2002. Each disc contains three episodes.\n\nEpisode list\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infamous_Murders&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infamous_Murders&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe1c580c34c14e80ebed607af251900836925e71","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Crimes+The+World%26rsquo%3Bs+Most+Infamous+Murders-1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe1c580c34c14e80ebed607af251900836925e71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,28,88,12,52,193,78,128,235,237,96,122,242,81,144,8,54,146,94,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
