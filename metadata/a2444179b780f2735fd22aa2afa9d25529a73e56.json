For the day's fourth and final match, Jellal is pit against Lamia Scale's Jura, intending to avenge the humiliated Fairy Tail members. He mimics Mystogan's magic to keep up his disguise, but finds it ineffective to use against Jura and uses his usual magic instead. Before he can cast a spell that will blow his cover, Ultear uses Meldy's sensory magic to playfully torture Jellal into submission, forcing him to lose the match. Meanwhile, the hospitalized Carla awakens after having another premonition of the future.\n[/quote]\n\nVideo: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC, 23fps\nQuality: 480p (848x480)\n\nAudio: Vorbis Audio 44kHz\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2444179b780f2735fd22aa2afa9d25529a73e56","amp;dn":"%5BVega004%5D+Fairy+Tail+-+160+%5B480p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2444179b780f2735fd22aa2afa9d25529a73e56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,68,65,121,183,128,242,115,95,210,42,162,175,169,210,85,41,167,62,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
