And now big labor is on board!\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) and Robert Reich(former U.S. Labor Secretary, UC Berkeley Professor), talked about the latest movement in the fight for the middle class.\n\nThen, a judge ordered mediation instead of allowing more than 18,000 jobs to vanish if the makers of Twinkies go out of business. Matt Taibbi (journalist for Rolling Stone), joined Ed for that.\n\nSen. John McCain asked for an apology from U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. Katrina Vanden Heuvel (Co-owner/Editor of The Nation magazine), sounded off on that one.\n\nTea Party Rep. Allen West has been defeated but he just won't quit.  Ed found out what's next from Mitch Ceasar (Democratic Chairman, Broward County, Florida).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b1ceaeb70943f0dff00dd31ae01ca61281a39e8","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+11-19-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b1ceaeb70943f0dff00dd31ae01ca61281a39e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,28,234,235,112,148,63,13,255,0,221,49,174,1,202,97,40,26,57,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
