Poe wrote lyrical poetry and macabre psychological melodramas; invented the first fictional detective; and produced pioneering works of science fiction and fantasy. His innovative style, images, and themes had a tremendous impact on European romanticism, symbolism, and surrealism, and continue to influence writers today.\n\nIn this essential addition to his canon of acclaimed biographies, Peter Ackroyd explores PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literary accomplishments and legacy against the background of his erratic, dramatic, and sometimes sordid life. Ackroyd chronicles PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult childhood, his bumpy academic and military careers, and his complex relationships with women, including his marriage to his thirteen-year-old cousin. He describes PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much-written-about problems with gambling and alcohol with sympathy and insight, showing their connections to PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood and the trials, as well as the triumphs, of his adult life. AckroydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughtful, perceptive examinations of some of PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous works shed new light on these classics and on the troubled and brilliant genius who created them.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0899d0ec415894ed0c350cdaed2a2425de10e33d","amp;dn":"Poe+-+A+Life+Cut+Short+-+Peter+Ackroyd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0899d0ec415894ed0c350cdaed2a2425de10e33d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,153,208,236,65,88,148,237,12,53,12,218,237,42,36,37,222,16,227,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
