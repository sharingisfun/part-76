Morse had two minds when it came to great old time\nradio shows........he did a wonderful family drama called &quot;One Man's Family,&quot;\nbut also was perhaps the finest adventure writer/director that radio had. His\ngreat show &quot;I Love A Mystery&quot; was (and still is) one of the most beloved of\nradio adventure shows. It was easy to see why.......the genius Morse touch was\nevident in twisting plots, odd but very believable characters, and wonderfully\ncolorful dialogue that was funny, charming and inventive as well as exciting.\n\nWarning: These old dramas may literally send shivers up and down your spine!!\n\nlinks for lots more Carlton E.
