Main features:\n\n- The speed, accelerations and physics of the units are taken to realistic levels\n- Various changes to morale and battle mechanics create more lasting battles\n- Projectiles are not homing to the targets\n- Increased unit sizes for epic battles\n- Removed all the insane cheats for the AI\n- Diplomacy and campaign AI have been improved\n- Autocalculation of battles works better.\n- Fortifications have more garrison troops\n- The economy system is slightly improved\n- Upgrade points for characters are increased from 2 to 3\n- Several annoying things, for the majority of players, are removed like the projectile trails (laser trails) and the Horo (Balloon). The removal of laser trails in combination with the reduced speeds brings a significant FPS increase\n- Increased army and navy control radius in the campaign map\n- Better naval battles\n- Ships have much more movement points\n- Clans have more diversity for their special units\n\nMany features are customizable.\n\nDarthMod works with single player (and possibly coop) campaigns of Shogun 2, Rise of Samurai, Fall of Samurai, and multiplayer matches - but other player(s) have to install this mod, and apply exactly the same settings.\n\nYou can also easily disable the mod with one click, and play vanilla game (required for multiplayer games with random people).\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a8258775b3b90841c0273a5f43c43c6b2fe2a31","amp;dn":"DarthMod%3A+Shogun+II+v4.4%2B+%28Plus%29+Enforced+Edition+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a8258775b3b90841c0273a5f43c43c6b2fe2a31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,130,88,119,91,59,144,132,28,2,115,165,244,60,67,198,178,254,42,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
