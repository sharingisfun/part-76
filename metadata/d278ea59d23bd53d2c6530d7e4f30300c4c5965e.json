The show ran for an extraordinary sixteen years, always topping the ratings, ending in 1986 with Ronnie Barker's early retirement.\n\nThe play explores the differences between the two: Corbett the happy-go-lucky sketch performer and extrovert, comfortable chatting to an audience; and Barker the shy introvert who needed to hide behind his characters to face an audience and worked like a demon behind the scenes.\n\nUsing parodies of some of their greatest sketches - Fork Handles, Mastermind and The Class Sketch from The Frost Report - Goodnight From Him tells the story of how two men worked together for twenty years without ever a cross word.\n\nWritten by Roy Smiles\n\nProducer: Liz Anstee,\nA CPL production for BBC Radio 4.\n\nCredits\nRonnie Barker - Robert Daws\nRonnie Corbett - Aidan McArdle\nDavid Frost - James Lance\nJohn Cleese - Matt Addis\nWriter - Roy Smiles\nProducer - Liz Anstee\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------File Information---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst broadcast: BBC R4 Afternoon Drama 27 May 2013\nType: MPEG 1.0 Layer 3 - 128 kbps mp3 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 44 khz - Joint Stereo\nDuration: 44 minutes\nCaptured with Radio Downloader, edited with mp3DirectCut\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d278ea59d23bd53d2c6530d7e4f30300c4c5965e","amp;dn":"Goodnight+from+Him+++%28BBC+Drama+-+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d278ea59d23bd53d2c6530d7e4f30300c4c5965e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,120,234,89,210,59,213,61,44,101,48,215,228,243,3,0,196,197,150,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
