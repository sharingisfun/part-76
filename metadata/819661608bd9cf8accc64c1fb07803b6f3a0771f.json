Hassan is a Persian with Coke-bottle glasses whose only pal is his ever-present donkey. His uncle runs a clothing store whose items never seem to fit his shoppers. A Turkmen minstrel pines for the wife he lost 30 years ago. Together, these characters go through the motions of living while preoccupied with escape. Against visually serene compositions and a plaintive score, Jalali teases out the intense longing hidden behind his charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stoic expressions, crafting a humane and drolly charming first feature that leaves an indelible impression.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:819661608bd9cf8accc64c1fb07803b6f3a0771f","amp;dn":"Frontier+Blues+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"819661608bd9cf8accc64c1fb07803b6f3a0771f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,150,97,96,139,217,207,138,204,198,76,31,176,120,3,182,243,160,119,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
