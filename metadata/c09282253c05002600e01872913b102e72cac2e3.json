The film is based on The Diaries Of Hanna Senesh and the biographical novel A Great Wind Cometh by Yoel Palgi. It is a biopic detailing the true story of Hannah Szenes.\n\nThis is part 2 of 2. Taken straight from VHS and encoded into PAL. The quality is not that great but it's amazing considering that this was taken straight from VHS.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c09282253c05002600e01872913b102e72cac2e3","amp;dn":"Hanna%27s+War+Part+2+PAL+EN.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c09282253c05002600e01872913b102e72cac2e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,146,130,37,60,5,0,38,0,224,24,114,145,59,16,46,114,202,194,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
