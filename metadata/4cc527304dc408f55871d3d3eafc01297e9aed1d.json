Tonight! Sold Out!! is a video album released by the grunge band Nirvana on laserdisc and VHS on November 15, 1994. The DVD version was released November 7, 2006. Kurt Cobain compiled much of the video himself, but did not complete it prior to his death. Surviving Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic worked with director Kevin Kerslake to complete the video, attempting to remain as close to Cobain's vision as possible.\nMost of the live footage is from 1991 and 1992, with home video footage dating back to late-1990. The latest footage is from January 23, 1993 at the Hollywood Rock Festival in Brazil. A message appears at the beginning of the film which states that the release was &quot;initially conceived and constructed in 1992/93&quot; and that &quot;circumstances did not allow for the piece to be completed by those who forged its original vision...&quot; A rough outline of the video appears in the book &quot;Journals&quot;. While in some ways a straightforward collection of concert clips, in accordance with Cobain's concept, the video presentation is often surreal and disjointed, as performance clips of individual songs are intercut with one another, and interview and documentary performance are layered in the manner of a montage.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nANEURYSM\nIn two parts: 1991.11.25 - Paradiso, Amsterdam, Holland, and 1993.01.23 - Hollywood Rock, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
