Manchester United come up against a Sam Allardyce-managed West Ham for the first time since the Hammers' promotion. Allardyce masterminded Bolton to famous victories at Old Trafford in 2001 and 2002, with current West Ham skipper Kevin Nolan on target on both occasions.\n\nChelsea and Fulham meet in a west London derby, while Manchester City travel to north west neighbours Wigan. Elsewhere, Everton welcome Arsenal to Goodison Park, looking to end their 10-match winless streak against the Gunners.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4eb52a4e58fa5e22d88e58203180b281edcb904","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+28.11.2012+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4eb52a4e58fa5e22d88e58203180b281edcb904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,235,82,164,229,143,165,226,45,136,229,130,3,24,11,40,30,220,185,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
