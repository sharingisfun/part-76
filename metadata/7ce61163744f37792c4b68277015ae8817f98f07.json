Named for its headquarters, an abandoned chapel, the Jump Street unit is comprised of youthful cops who can pose as teenagers, making it easier for them to bust criminals and drug dealers who prey upon high-school kids. After the initial pilot, Jeff_Yagher was replaced, and the role of Tom Hanson went to Johnny_Depp, an assignment that would make him a star. Hanson's fellow officers during season one include Doug Penhall (Peter DeLuise), who in the earlier episodes projects a more roly-poly, comic image than he would in future years; Vietnamese refugee Harry Truman Ioki (Dustin_Nguyen); and African-American Judy Hoffs (Holly_Robinson). For the first six episodes, the team takes its orders from Captain Richard Jenko (Frederic_Forrest), an ex-hippie who is more or less simpatico with their youthful zeal and tendency to bend the rules. But when Jenko is killed by a drunk driver, he is replaced by a more traditional, by-the-book leader, Captain Adam Fuller (Steven_Williams). The series' first batch of 13 hour-long episode features a number of soon-to-be stars in guest roles, among them Josh_Brolin, David_Paymer, and Jason_Priestley. 21 Jump Street managed to hold its own against the formidable competition of CBS' 60_Minutes during the series' maiden season, rapidly establishing Fox as the favorite network of teens and young adults.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092312/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092312/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Jump_Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Jump_Street&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce61163744f37792c4b68277015ae8817f98f07","amp;dn":"21+Jump+Street+-+S01E04+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce61163744f37792c4b68277015ae8817f98f07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,230,17,99,116,79,55,121,44,75,104,39,112,21,174,136,23,249,143,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
