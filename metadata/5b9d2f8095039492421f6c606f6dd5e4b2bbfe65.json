Sven Co-op was released on January 19, 1999 - before Valve's Team Fortress Classic - and is therefore the oldest Half-Life mod in existence that is still in development. It has since grown to become a full blown mod, with a full team, and one of the most played games on Steam as of September 18, 2006, excluding the official games by Valve.\n\nEnjoy!
