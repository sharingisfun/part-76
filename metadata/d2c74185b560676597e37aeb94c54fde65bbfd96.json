He also translated many books of Abdolkarim Soroush into Arabic.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c74185b560676597e37aeb94c54fde65bbfd96","amp;dn":"Ahmed+Al-Gubbanchi+-+Batch+%23+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c74185b560676597e37aeb94c54fde65bbfd96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,199,65,133,181,96,103,101,151,227,122,235,148,197,79,222,101,187,253,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
