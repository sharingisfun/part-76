It protects endpoints by Freezing the desired configuration set by you Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the IT professional. Any unwelcome or unwanted changes users make while in-session are prevented from sticking. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really simple. By restarting your computers, systems are returned to the desired state. Meanwhile, user data can be stored safely on a network drive or in a ThawSpace to be retained across reboots. This helps machines run smoothly and efficiently, while giving you more up-time and boosting user productivity. The built-in Deep Freeze Enterprise Console or Core Console makes life even easier.\n\nDeep FreezeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s central management capabilities allow you to enjoy the benefits of customizing, deploying, and managing Deep Freeze on your endpoints from one central location. Need to manage Windows Updates? Simply download them while Frozen and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re automatically applied when machines are Thawed. Once the process is finished, machines are automatically returned to their Frozen state.\n\nSince Deep Freeze ensures 100% workstation recovery with every restart, you can watch that mountain of support tickets shrink. Customers report an average reduction of 63%. You can also forget about accidental configuration changes, malicious software, and operating system degradation. Now you and your IT staff can get more sleep, worry less, and maybe even leave the office on time once in a while.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19bb19455d5529309dcee53bb328dbea36c37588","amp;dn":"DFStd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19bb19455d5529309dcee53bb328dbea36c37588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,187,25,69,93,85,41,48,157,206,229,59,179,40,219,234,54,195,117,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
