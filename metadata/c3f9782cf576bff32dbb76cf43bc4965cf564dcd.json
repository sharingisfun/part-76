Val's father, Armand, owns The Birdcage, a South Beach drag club. His domestic partner is Albert, who appears regularly as &quot;Starina,&quot; the show's star drag queen. Barbara's father is ultraconservative Republican Ohio Senator Kevin Keeley, who is seeking re-election as the co-founder of the &quot;Coalition for Moral Order&quot;. Fearing their reaction if they learn the truth about Val's parents, Barbara tells her parents that Armand is a cultural attachÃƒÂ© to Greece, that Albert is a housewife, and that they divide their time between Greece and Florida; she also changes the family's last name from Goldman to Coleman to hide their Jewish background.\n\n\n* Video *\n\nLength:         1 hour 54 minutes\nFrame Width:    704\nFrame Height:   368\nData Rate:      723kbps\nTotal Bitrate:  851kbps\nFrame Rate:     25fps\n\n* Audio *\n\nBit rate:       128kbps\nChannels:       2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:    48kHz\n\n* Cast Sars *\n\nRobin Williams (Armand)\nGene Hackman (Senator Keeley)\nNathan Lane (Albert / Starina)\nDianne Wiest (Louise Keeley)\n\n\nI hope you enjoy, please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f9782cf576bff32dbb76cf43bc4965cf564dcd","amp;dn":"The+Birdcage+-+AVI+-+%2ABP-LPC%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f9782cf576bff32dbb76cf43bc4965cf564dcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,249,120,44,245,118,191,243,45,187,118,207,67,188,73,101,207,86,77,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
