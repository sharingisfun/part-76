Since then they have been taken down (no seeders) and this torrent is the only one I know of that exists. From the looks of it they were made sometime during the 1990's. There are three parts:\n\n1. Basic techniques\n2. Advanced techinques\n3. Street fighting application (at least that's as best as I can tell)\n\nThe audio is in Russian and and there's lots of funky music that doesn't really belong in a set of combat instructional videos (Patricia Kass, Double - The Captain of Her Heart) but these tapes were jammed packed with techniques and there are lots of really unique fighting moves. Enjoyable.\n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f40dc63b26c8122bc3cf28d0eb3001616dd5a5c","amp;dn":"Thiang+Bando","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f40dc63b26c8122bc3cf28d0eb3001616dd5a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,64,220,99,178,108,129,34,188,60,242,141,14,179,0,22,22,221,90,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
