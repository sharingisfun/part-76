If I was doomed to live in a trailer park next to an airport, I could complain about the smell of the jet fuel like my mom, I could drink myself to death over the noise like everybody else, or I could learn to fly.\n\nHeaven Beach, South Carolina, is anything but, if you live at the low-rent end of town. All her life, Leah Jones has been the grown-up in her family, while her mother moves from boyfriend to boyfriend, letting any available money slip out of her hands. At school, they may diss Leah as trash, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the one who negotiates with the landlord when the rentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not paid. At fourteen, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the one who gets a job at the nearby airstrip.\n\nBut thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one way Leah can escape reality. Saving every penny she can, she begs quiet Mr. Hall, who runs an aerial banner-advertising business at the airstrip and also offers flight lessons, to take her up just once. Leaving the trailer park far beneath her and swooping out over the sea is a rush greater than anything sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever experienced, and when Mr. Hall offers to give her cut-rate flight lessons, she feels ready to touch the sky.\n\nBy the time sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a high school senior, Leah has become a good enough pilot that Mr. Hall offers her a job flying a banner plane. It seems like a dream come true . . . but turns out to be just as fleeting as any dream. Mr. Hall dies suddenly, leaving everything he owned in the hands of his teenage sons: golden boy Alec and adrenaline junkie Grayson. And theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re determined to keep the banner planes flying.\n\nThough Leah has crushed on Grayson for years, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leery of getting involved in what now seems like a doomed businessÃ¢â‚¬â€until Grayson betrays her by digging up her most damning secret. Holding it over her head, he forces her to fly for secret reasons of his own, reasons involving Alec. Now Leah finds herself drawn into a battle between brothersÃ¢â‚¬â€and the consequences could be deadly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd32108b63f3bee8863515391010805d4393e852","amp;dn":"Such+a+Rush+-+Jennifer+Echols","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd32108b63f3bee8863515391010805d4393e852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,50,16,139,99,243,190,232,134,53,21,57,16,16,128,93,67,147,232,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
