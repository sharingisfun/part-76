A solemn yet humorous exploration of seniority, the film tells a bittersweet story revolving around the lives of elderly maid Sister Tao and her master, played respectively by veteran actress Deanie Ip and superstar Andy Lau, whose past screen collaborations serve to inspire enormous chemistry between their characters. Their impeccable performances have earned numerous prestigious prizes for the film, including Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival, Best Director, Actor, and Actress at the Golden Horse Awards, and the rare feat of the Big Five (Best Film, Director, Screenplay, Actor, and Actress) at the Hong Kong Film Awards.\n\nBased on the true story of producer Roger Lee, A Simple Life also features a number of famous stars and filmmakers in supporting or cameo roles, including Qin Hailu, Anthony Wong, Paul Chun, Chapman To, and Sammo Hung, among many others. Sister Tao (Deanie Ip) has served five generations of the Leung family since she was thirteen. Today, at over seventy years old, she continues to take care of Roger (Andy Lau), the only member of the family left in Hong Kong. After suffering a stroke at home one day, Tao realizes it's about time she retired, so she asks Roger to find her a nursing home for rehabilitation. Tao struggles to adjust to the strange new environment as well as her eccentric fellow inmates, but Roger is there to care for this mother figure who has devoted her life to his.\n\nHong Kong Version DVD comes with film trailers, making-of, deleted scenes, and director and stars interviews.\n\nLength : 118 minutes\nAudio : Cantonese (2.0 &amp; 5.0), Mandarin (2.0 &amp; 5.0)\nSubtitles : English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese\n\nWikipedia Link : &lt;a href=&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Simple_Life&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Simple_Life&lt;/a&gt;\niMDb Link : &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2008006/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2008006/&lt;/a&gt;\nHKMDb Link : &lt;a href=&quot; http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=14729&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=14729&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:921dea64fabae7a4cd8991d1db2705bd82511b65","amp;dn":"%E6%A1%83%E5%A7%90+A+Simple+Life+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"921dea64fabae7a4cd8991d1db2705bd82511b65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,29,234,100,250,186,231,164,205,137,145,209,219,39,5,189,130,81,27,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
