It consists of seven songs written and sung by Dylan, with the Dead providing accompaniment. The album was produced by Jerry Garcia and John Cutler.\nDylan &amp; the Dead was recorded in 1987, during a successful stadium tour of the same name. Songs from two of the Grateful Dead performances are documented on the album View from the Vault IV.\nThe album sold well, reaching #37 on the Billboard charts in the U.S., #38 in the UK, and earning gold status in the United States.\n\nReviews\n\n\nDespite strong initial sales, the album was poorly received by critics. Rolling Stone stated that the record &quot;makes you wonder what the fuss [over the tour] was about,&quot; although they did have some kind words for several of the tracks. Writing for The Village Voice, influential music critic Robert Christgau said that what Dylan &quot;makes of his catalogue here is exactly what he's been making of it for yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€money.&quot; Amazon.com's Steve Appleford lamented that &quot;if these were the stadium tour's best performances, pity anyone who actually sat through one of these concerts with a clear head.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine's review for AllMusic was particularly harsh, giving it one star out of a possible five, and calling it &quot;quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead&quot; and &quot;a sad, disheartening document.&quot;\nTrack listing\n\nSide One\t\n\n\nNo.\tTitle   \tWriter(s)\tLength\t\n\n1.\t&quot;Slow Train&quot; (Recorded in Foxborough, Massachusetts on July 4, 1987)\tBob Dylan\t4:54\n2.\t&quot;I Want You&quot; (Recorded in Oakland, California on July 24, 1987)\tDylan\t3:59\n3.\t&quot;Gotta Serve Somebody&quot; (Recorded in Anaheim, California on July 26, 1987)\tDylan\t5:42\n4.\t&quot;Queen Jane Approximately&quot; (Recorded in Eugene, Oregon on July 19, 1987)\tDylan\t6:30\nSide Two\t\nNo.\tTitle\tWriter(s)\tLength\t\n5.\t&quot;Joey&quot; (Recorded in Foxborough, Massachusetts on July 4, 1987)\tDylan, Jacques Levy\t9:10\n6.\t&quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; (Recorded in Anaheim, California on July 26, 1987)\tDylan\t6:17\n7.\t&quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot; (Recorded in Anaheim, California on July 26, 1987)\tDylan\t6:35\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nBob Dylan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals\nJerry Garcia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals, production\nMickey Hart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nBill Kreutzmann Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nPhil Lesh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\nBrent Mydland Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, vocals\nBob Weir Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals\nTechnical personnel\nGuy Charbonneau Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineering\nJohn Cutler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ production, engineering\nJoe Gastwirt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mastering\nHerb Greene Ã¢â‚¬â€œ photography\nRick Griffin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ art direction\nGary Hedden Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineering\nPeter Miller Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineering\nDavid Roberts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineering\nBilly Rothschild Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineering\nChris Wiskes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineering\n\n\n\nPlease Seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd3470d52ab8b10063460a9d951f4c2c90fda9f7","amp;dn":"Dylan+%26amp%3B+The+Dead+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd3470d52ab8b10063460a9d951f4c2c90fda9f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,52,112,213,42,184,177,0,99,70,10,157,149,31,76,44,144,253,169,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
