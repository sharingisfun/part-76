It objectively and methodically documents the hidden alliance between new versions and the New Age Movement's One World Religion. The emerging new Christianity - with its substitution of riches for righteousness, a crown for a cross, and an imitation for a new creation - is shown to be a direct result of the wording in new versions. Gale exposes new version editors' in agreement with Luciferians, occultists, and New Age philosophy in mental institutions, sÃƒÂ©ance parlors, prison cells, and court rooms for heresy trials, and most shocking of all; denying that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ.\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nModern Translations and the Spirit of the Antichrist:\nAre Modern Translations Trustworthy?
