Although now in his senior year, he is still persecuted by the aggressive rugby team, on whose captain, Jonathon (Nathaniel David Becker), he has a crush. Timothy lives with his mother, Donna (Judy McLane), who is struggling with her son's sexuality and with getting a job, and his father who is not a part of his life.\nTimothy is cast as Puck in the senior production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. While reviewing his lines, he discovers the recipe for creating the flower love-in-idleness. Timothy uses the flower to have the homophobic town take a &quot;walk in his shoes&quot;. The entire town is thrown into chaos as previously heterosexual community members fall in love with their same-sex friends, bosses, and co-workers: whomever they first saw after being sprayed by the flower. The school drama teacher, Ms. Tebbit (Wendy Robie), guides Timothy towards the question of whether his actions have caused more harm than good.\n\nMovie Stills:\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1342.beta.photobucket.com/user/jake_horman1/media/WereTheWorldMineCover.jpg.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o771/jake_horman1/WereTheWorldMineCover.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Photobucket&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1342.beta.photobucket.com/user/jake_horman1/media/weretheworldminephoto.jpg.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o771/jake_horman1/weretheworldminephoto.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Photobucket&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1342.beta.photobucket.com/user/jake_horman1/media/weretheworldminephoto3.jpg.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o771/jake_horman1/weretheworldminephoto3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Photobucket&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1342.beta.photobucket.com/user/jake_horman1/media/weretheworldminephoto2.jpg.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o771/jake_horman1/weretheworldminephoto2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Photobucket&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWell, Not sure what else to say so....\n\n\nHere goes nothing\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:126a0815c49b46366078e27fe329bbffb67a0b66","amp;dn":"Were+The+World+Mine.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"126a0815c49b46366078e27fe329bbffb67a0b66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,106,8,21,196,155,70,54,96,120,226,127,227,41,187,255,182,122,11,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
