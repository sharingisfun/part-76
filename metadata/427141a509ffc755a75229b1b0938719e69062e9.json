A sort of comic concrete poem book.\n\nNot a great book, but a very interesting one. Certainly it's very grounded in the time it was produced. But it's still a real shame that it never went any further. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:427141a509ffc755a75229b1b0938719e69062e9","amp;dn":"The+Big+Trucker+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"427141a509ffc755a75229b1b0938719e69062e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,113,65,165,9,255,199,85,167,82,41,177,176,147,135,25,230,144,98,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
