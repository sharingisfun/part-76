This interest has long\n  since ceased to be a question of idle curiosity: &quot;Is space travel\n  possible?&quot; Every pupil now knows the answer to this question. The\n  interest of our young people in the problem of space travel has\n  assumed quite concrete form. They want to know what interplanetary\n  flights are possible today, at the present level of scientific and\n  technical development, they want to know what achievements have\n  been attained in the development of remarkable reaction engines,\n  which will be the vital part of any interplanetary vessel. These\n  young people question the astronomers about the routes of future\n  cosmic flights. They question the doctors about the specific effects\n  of space travel on the human organism. They are interest- ed in the\n  possibility of a collision between a space ship and meteors, in the\n  possibility of using artificial satellites of the Earth and in many\n  other things.  In a few words, our youth are keenly interested in\n  all the problems covered by the science of space travel. This\n  science has already developed to such an extent, especially during\n  the past decade, that it is impossible even to attempt any detailed\n  account of its achievements in any one book.  If this publication\n  succeeds in replying to some of the questions put by our young\n  readers, if it arouses their greater interest and curiosity, its aim\n  will have been achieved.\n  \n  This book was translated from the Russian by Pauline Rose and\n  illustrated by N. Kolchitsky and designed by G. Dauman. The book was\n  published by Foreign Languages Publishing House in 1957.\n  \n  All credits to the Osmania University for releasing this book in\n  public domain and thanks to the Internet Archive for storing this book.\n\n  PDF | OCR | 12.9 MB | Pages: 272 | \n\n\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\t\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCONTENTS\n\nAuthor's Note 7\n\nThe World About Us (Introduction) 9\n\nPart One\nFROM FANTASY TO SCIENCE\nChapter 1.
