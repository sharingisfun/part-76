See The Bell Curve (book). In particular the public schools with entrenched teachers' unions, have not responded to increased spending with better results.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2138b2ad02e4b9d42421ac0ebfcbc4f1271a4d8e","amp;dn":"The+Daily+Show-2012.12.12-Cory+Booker+Extended+Interview.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2138b2ad02e4b9d42421ac0ebfcbc4f1271a4d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,56,178,173,2,228,185,212,36,33,172,14,191,203,196,241,39,26,77,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
