Based off of Zork, Null is a text-based open-world game where you roam what remains of Earth in hopes that you can dominate all that remains. It is still a work in progress and will constantly be updated. To install the game, all you have to do is extract the files to a desired directory and launch Null.exe.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\nCHEATS/COMMANDS:\nF1- After an NPC warns you about their strength level, press F1 when focused on the form to have the battle simulated 100 times. If you win 80% or more of the time, the game will tell you to attack.\nF2- Press F2 when focused on the form to start up Al. Al will play for you when you're AFK by attacking NPCs and buying potions. Although he has a 15% of killing you, he is very useful. He will only play when you are focused on the form.\nF3- When focused on the form, press F3 to stop Al from playing and give control to yourself.\nGrave key(~) or Tilde(`)- When focused on the input textbox, press this key to open the developer's console, giving you serveral commands to play/cheat with.\nUSE- Type in USE and press enter to use your purchased potions.\nHELP- Type in HELP and press enter to see what you can input.\nUP ARROW- When focused on the input textbox, press the up arrow and it will automatically input either RUN, TALK, IGNORE, or TRADE based on the context.\nSTATS- Type in STATS and press enter to see your current stats.\nINVENTORY- Type in INVENTORY and press enter to see your inventory.\nMUTE- Type in MUTE and press enter to mute the game. Type it in again to un-mute.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI coded this game using Visual Basics C++\nMANA currently doesn't have a use but will in future updates.\nIf you encounter any bugs or questions, feel free to email me at: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b2d3dcd6c0dddcd7c5c2c181f2dedbc4d79cd1d3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3521032a5b1de1bf6399c82e9c964f491dd2d92a","amp;dn":"Null+1.0.0.0+Beta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3521032a5b1de1bf6399c82e9c964f491dd2d92a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,33,3,42,91,29,225,191,99,153,200,46,156,150,79,73,29,210,217,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
