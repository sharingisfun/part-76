I am doing so, because I'm told the one I uploaded yesterday did not work (I would have known had I thought to test the zip, which I shouldn't have even HAD in it).\n\nCut from the old description: &quot;All 57 episodes of the show as of Dec.4.2012. Most are 1080p, at least one is 720p, though.\n\nS301 and S302 are in one file, though the other episodes each get their own.\n\nAll episodes are in MP4 format, if that matters to anybody.\n\n\nI don't believe I'll uploading any episodes that air after these, but if you're after them, get a Youtube video downloading program (I recommend DVDvideosoft), check Equestria Daily's stickies every Saturday evening, and get yourself the 1080p version.&quot;\n\nNo .zip this time, since I now know that you can't compress video files...something I should've known had I, you know, GOOGLED IT.\n\nEither way, I'm pretty sure this one works. If it doesn't, just leave a comment and I'll do...well, something.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23045cc6ea02d74145ffdf352e4d9e5abd4bb06b","amp;dn":"MLP%3AFIM+Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23045cc6ea02d74145ffdf352e4d9e5abd4bb06b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,4,92,198,234,2,215,65,69,255,223,53,46,77,158,90,189,75,176,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
