On the \nLower East Side, two boys playing at a pier discover a floating human torso \nwrapped tightly in oilcloth. Blueberry pickers near Harlem stumble upon neatly \nsevered limbs in an overgrown ditch. Clues to a horrifying crime are turning \nup all over New York, but the police are baffled: There are no witnesses, no \nmotives, no suspects.\n\nThe grisly finds that began on the afternoon of June 26, 1897, plunged \ndetectives headlong into the eraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most baffling murder mystery. Seized upon \nby battling media moguls Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst, the \ncase became a publicity circus. Reenactments of the murder were staged in \nTimes Square, armed reporters lurked in the streets of HellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kitchen in pursuit \nof suspects, and an unlikely trioÃ¢â‚¬â€a hard-luck cop, a cub reporter, and an \neccentric professorÃ¢â‚¬â€all raced to solve the crime.\n\nWhat emerged was a sensational love triangle and an even more sensational \ntrial: an unprecedented capital case hinging on circumstantial evidence \naround a victim whom the police couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t identify with certainty, and who the \ndefense claimed wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even dead. The Murder of the Century is a rollicking \ntaleÃ¢â‚¬â€a rich evocation of America during the Gilded Age and a colorful re-\ncreation of the tabloid wars that have dominated media to this day.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nJames McGrath Morris\nPaul Collins engagingly recounts the press's obsessive pursuit of the story, \nthe unlikely alliances that eventually led to the apprehension of the suspects \nand the trialÃ¢â‚¬Â¦[he] has crafted a work that won't disappoint readers in search \nof a book like Erik Larson's The Devil in the White City.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc8bee37e21e502f79ed02f71168f26939636251","amp;dn":"Paul+Collins+-+The+Murder+of+the+Century+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc8bee37e21e502f79ed02f71168f26939636251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,139,238,55,226,30,80,47,121,237,2,247,17,104,242,105,57,99,98,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
