In Manhattan, Prior Walter tells Lou, his lover of four years, that he has AIDS; Lou, unable to handle it, leaves him. As disease and loneliness ravage Prior, guilt invades Lou. Joe Pitt, a Mormon and Republican attorney, is pushed by right-wing fixer Roy Cohn toward a job at the United States Department of Justice. Both Pitt and Cohn are in the closet: Pitt out of shame and religious turmoil, Cohn to preserve his power and image. Pitt's wife Harper is strung out on Valium, causing her to hallucinate constantly (sometimes jointly with Prior during his fever dreams), and she longs to escape from her sexless marriage. An angel with ulterior motives commands Prior to become a prophet. Pitt's mother and Belize, a close friend and drag queen, help Prior choose. Joe leaves his wife and goes to live with Lou, but the relationship doesn't work out due to ideological differences. Roy is diagnosed with AIDS early on, and as his life comes to a close he is haunted by the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg.\nAs the film continues, these lost souls come together to create bonds of love, loss, and loneliness and, in the end, discover forgiveness and overcome abandonment.\n\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: Dutch\nGenres: Drama | Fantasy\n\nCast\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAl Pacino as Roy Cohn\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMeryl Streep as Hannah Pitt / Ethel Rosenberg / The Rabbi / The Angel Australia\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tPatrick Wilson as Joe Pitt\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMary-Louise Parker as Harper Pitt\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tEmma Thompson as Nurse Emily / Homeless woman / The Angel America\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tJustin Kirk as Prior Walter / Leatherman in park\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tJeffrey Wright as Mr. Lies / Norman &quot;Belize&quot; Ariaga / Homeless man / The Angel Europa\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tBen Shenkman as Louis Ironson / The Angel Oceania\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tJames Cromwell as Henry, Roy's doctor\n\n[url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318997/][img]http://hetmultimediacafe.nl/images/afbeeldingen/imdb.png[/img][/url]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7b9c87c846a2b9f511fd538479dbfe736e470fb","amp;dn":"Angels+in+America+-+part+2-DutchReleaseTeam-DVDRIP-NLSubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7b9c87c846a2b9f511fd538479dbfe736e470fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,185,200,124,132,106,43,159,81,31,213,56,71,157,191,231,54,228,112,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
