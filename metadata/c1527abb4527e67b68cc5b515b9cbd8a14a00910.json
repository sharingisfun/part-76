On the one hand, the sonatas reflect BartÃƒÂ³k's seriousness in working formally with the folk songs he had collected and incorporated it into his idiom, while on the other, the rhapsodies provided a lighter and more engaging showcase of regional melodies, for use as recital encores. Ehnes and his accompanist Andrew Strong are excellent guides to this body of work, which ranges from naÃƒÂ¯vely tuneful and colorful regional dance styles, to the most abstract explorations of sonority for its own sake. With the exception of the early Andante, which is a post-Romantic parlor piece with a wistful charm, the pieces show the modernist BartÃƒÂ³k of the 1920s, and the development of his dry and resilient style is often in evidence. That Ehnes can play sweetly and smoothly is shown sufficiently in the Andante, but the writing in the later pieces is often full of caustic multistops and abrasive dissonances, and he often has to play with considerable grit and roughness to communicate the desired effects. Chandos' sound is clear and focused, with a good balance between the violin and piano, so both musicians are able to share the spotlight.\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 1/31/2012\nUPC: 095115170526\nLabel: Chandos\nCatalog Number: 10705\n\n01 - Rhapsody No. 1 (Folk Dances), BB 94a- I.
