First, we see the code in imperative form: code that mutates data, with the code and data being separated. Then we merge some of the data and code to form an object to get object oriented code: code and data mixed, with mutation. We quickly look at a variant of this where the object is only allowed to have pure functions (no mutation or IO). Finally, we remove the object, leaving only the functions, which gives us a more standard functional solution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb5b8f8088125f133297633184c2af073d7c07b0","amp;dn":"DAS+%2381%3A+IMPERATIVE+TO+OO+TO+FUNCTIONAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb5b8f8088125f133297633184c2af073d7c07b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,91,143,128,136,18,95,19,50,151,99,49,132,194,175,7,61,124,7,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
