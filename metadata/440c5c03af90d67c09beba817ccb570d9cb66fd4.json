The film stars Mohan Agashe and Smita Patil in lead roles. The film won President's Silver Medal for Best Feature Film in Marathi at National Film Awards.\nIt is based on a book by G. N. Dandekar. \n\nThe story revolves around a tribal caste called the Thakar. Nagya is a drummer who has a passion for being a &quot;pure one&quot; (punyavant). He meets Chindhi, who has abandoned her husband as she considers him useless. They both fall in love and strive hard to be united. Once when Nagya goes to jungle for wood-cutting, a queen honey bee attacks him and one of his eyes is injured. He decides to take revenge. The beehives are located high on a nearby difficult to climb peak {Lingoba}. He decides to cut all the beehives so that the queen-bee runs away. Meanwhile Chindhi becomes pregnant with Nagya, but she still supports his dangerous attempt to climb the peak. Nagya then climbs the peak and cuts the hives. Chindhi is waiting at the base of the peak, but the disturbed honey-bees attack her and she dies in the incident. Nagya, in search of Queen honey-bee, loses his own queen[wife] in the end. This is a classic paradox, where he succeeds {Jait re jait, means WIN-WIN]in his revenge, but loses wife.\n\nThe film highlights all the traditions of the Thakar tribe of Maharashtra.\n\nOne of the rare gems Marathi movie industry has produced.. The combination of director Jabbar Patel and actor Mohan Agashe who had done an excellent job in th e play Ghashiram Kotwal have produced another gem.\n\nEverything about the movie is perfect. The cinematography could not have been better. However the best thing about the movie is its music which is still on everyone's tongue. Not only are the songs brilliant with brilliant lyrics by Na. Dho. Mahanor, but the music also fits perfectly with the movie. The movie is almost a semi-musical.\n\nIt is considered to be one of the greatest musical hits of all time in Marathi cinema.:\n1.&quot;Gorya Dehavarti&quot;Usha Mangeshkar, Ravindra Sathe\n2.&quot;Nabh Utaru Aala, Chimba Tharthar Valla&quot;Asha Bhosale\n3.&quot;Jambhul Piklya Zaadakhali&quot;Asha Bhosale, Ravindra Sathe\n4.&quot;Lingobacha Dongur&quot;Ravindra Sathe, Chandrakant Kale\n5.&quot;Wadi Varlya Waata&quot;\n6.&quot;Ha Doliya&quot;\n7.&quot;Mee Raat Taakli, Me Kaat Taakli&quot;Lata Mangeshkar, Ravindra Sathe, Chandrakant Kale\n8.&quot;Dongar Kathadi Thakarwadi&quot;Ravindra Sathe, Chandrakant Kale\n9.&quot;Kunya Raajan Raajan&quot;\n10.&quot;Aamhi Thakar Thakar&quot;Ravindra Sathe, Chandrakant Kale \n11.&quot;Pik Karpal&quot;Ravindra Sathe\n12.&quot;Hee Dusryachi Baael&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251151/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251151/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast\nMohan Agashe as Nagya\nSmita Patil as Chindhi\nSulabha Deshpande\nNilu Phule\nSeema\nShriram Ranade \n\nMedia Info\nLanguage - Marathi\nVideo Codec - AVC\nVideo Container - MPEG-4\nVideo Size - 700 MB\nVideo Resolution - 640 x 480\nVideo Frame Rate - 23.976 fps\nVideo Bitrate - 845 kbps\nAudio Codec - MP3\nAudio Channels - Stereo\nAudio Sampling Rate - 24000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate - 64 kbps\nMovie Duration - 1 Hours 55 mins\n\nPosters: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SJHT9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SJHT9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HqARy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HqARy.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/v38lz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/v38lz.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UHiIF.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UHiIF.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Gub0A.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Gub0A.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4ejPp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4ejPp.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jEs4J.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jEs4J.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NJOXk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NJOXk.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Dk2lX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Dk2lX.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JdEmv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JdEmv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTakes me 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 2 Hours to Upload &amp; Months to Seed\n\nTakes me 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\n\nTakes you just 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.
