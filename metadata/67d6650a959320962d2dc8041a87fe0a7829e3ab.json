Music overhaul for skyrim. This version replaces all of the music in-game. Not the &quot;replaces only some of the music&quot; version. It can't beat the original soundtrack of skyrim, but its a nice change to listen to something different. Also Im new to the community so I thought I'd say hi with this.\nI also liked the music alot, so I decided to convert the files from .XWM to .MP3 for those who didn't want to go through the trouble. Which I will upload after this is done. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67d6650a959320962d2dc8041a87fe0a7829e3ab","amp;dn":"AMO-Ambience+Music+Overhaul+Skyrim+Mod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67d6650a959320962d2dc8041a87fe0a7829e3ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,214,101,10,149,147,32,150,45,45,200,4,26,135,254,10,120,41,227,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
