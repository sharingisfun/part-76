It is part goat, part spider, and its milk can be used to create artificial spiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s web.\n\nIt is part of a new field of research, synthetic biology, with a radical aim: to break down nature into spare parts so that we can rebuild it however we please.\n\nThis technology is already being used to make bio-diesel to power cars.
