Written by Bill Kelly and directed by Kevin Lima, the film stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall, Idina Menzel, Rachel Covey, and Susan Sarandon. The plot focuses on Giselle, an archetypal Disney Princess, who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of New York City.\nThe film is both an homage to, and a self-parody of, conventional Walt Disney Animated Classics, making numerous references to Disney's past and future works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, traditional animation and computer-generated imagery. It heralds the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had written songs for previous Disney films, produced the songs of Enchanted, with Menken also composing its score.\nThe animation sequences were produced at James Baxter Animation in Pasadena. Filming of the live action segments took place around New York City. It premiered on October 20, 2007, at the London Film Festival before its wide release on November 21, 2007, in the United States. Enchanted was well-received critically. It won the 2007 Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Motion Picture, received two nominations at the 65th Golden Globe Awards and three nominations at the 80th Academy Awards. The film earned more than $340 million worldwide at the box office.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVideo        :  MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x544 23.976fps 703kbps\n\nAudio        :  AAC 48000Hz stereo 634kbps\n\nGenre        :  Comedy/Family/Fantasy\n \nRuntime      :  107 mins\n\nIMBD Rating  :  7.2\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6507ab818cddb5870ba4bea10677adbd12b84a6","amp;dn":"Enchanted+%282007%29+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6507ab818cddb5870ba4bea10677adbd12b84a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,80,122,184,24,205,219,88,112,186,75,234,16,103,122,219,209,43,132,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
