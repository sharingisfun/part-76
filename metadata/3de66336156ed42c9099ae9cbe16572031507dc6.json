The Enemy has discovered something that may tip the balance of the war in their favor, and now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Jude, the absentee leader of the warrior-priesthood known as the Chosen, and his new trainee Paul, to rally the disjointed forces of Heaven on Earth and find the source of this new threat. If they fail, it will mean that the forces of Hell will be free to run rampant across the Earth, ultimately leading to Armageddon and the end of all things. In the war between Heaven and Hell heroes are not madeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Chosen.\n\nNow available on the Kindle and in paperback! \nPlease visit www.authenticentertainment.net for more information on this and other novels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3de66336156ed42c9099ae9cbe16572031507dc6","amp;dn":"5+Chapter+Preview+of+The+Chosen%3A+Rebirthing+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3de66336156ed42c9099ae9cbe16572031507dc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,230,99,54,21,110,212,44,144,153,174,156,190,22,87,32,49,80,125,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
