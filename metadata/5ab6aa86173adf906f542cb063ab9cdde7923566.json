Experience the age of heroes: roleplaying action &amp; realtime strategy in a perfect mix of genres.\n\nInstallation: Unzip. Copy app to your Applications folder and launch.\n\nThis game runs perfectly, actually better than on Windows 7 on which it doesn't run at all! LOL. I have pre-patched the game to version 2.01.\n\nNote: Don't click the options button in-game unless you have to (I've maxed everything anyway) due a high-res widescreen hack explained below..\n\nWidescreen hack: Going into the options screen in-game will wipe any custom widescreen resolution changing it to the default 1024x768. This is just a limitation of the game, however it can be worked around fairly easily. I have already set it for you at the most compatible widescreen mac res (1280x800), which is best suited for 13&quot; Macbooks. Anyone with a higher res screen will want to change this..\n\nChanging resoluton: The easiest way to set your own res is to right-click on the app and choose &quot;Show Package Contents&quot; then type in the search bar (next to magnify glass): config.xml then click &quot;Spellforce 2&quot; next to Search:. If it doesn't show up the path is found at the location on this image (the path so fucking long I couldn't be bothered typing it ;p):\n\nRight click on this file and select Open With -&gt; Textedit or Other.. then type textedit and open. Find the values screenheight=&quot;800&quot; screenwidth=&quot;1280&quot; and change them to your native res (ie. screenheight=&quot;1080&quot; screenwidth=&quot;1920&quot; for 1920x1080). Save your file (Command+S) and exit textedit. Now when you launch the game it will be in your specified resolution.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ab6aa86173adf906f542cb063ab9cdde7923566","amp;dn":"SpellForce+2+-+Gold+Edition+for+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ab6aa86173adf906f542cb063ab9cdde7923566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,182,170,134,23,58,223,144,111,84,44,176,99,171,156,221,231,146,53,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
