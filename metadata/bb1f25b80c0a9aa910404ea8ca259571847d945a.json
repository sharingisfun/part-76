The story is a satirical critique of unthinking militarism and concerns a spoiled and tyrannical young Grand Duchess who learns that she cannot always get her way. \nThe opera premiered in Paris in 1867 and starred Hortense Schneider in the title role. Thereafter, it was heard in New York, London and elsewhere, and it is still performed and recorded.\n\nTo learn more about this piece, look on wikipedia en:\n\nLa Grande-Duchesse de Gerolstein","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb1f25b80c0a9aa910404ea8ca259571847d945a","amp;dn":"Offenbach+-+La+Grande-Duchesse+de+Gerolstein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb1f25b80c0a9aa910404ea8ca259571847d945a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,31,37,184,12,10,154,169,16,64,78,168,202,37,149,113,132,125,148,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
