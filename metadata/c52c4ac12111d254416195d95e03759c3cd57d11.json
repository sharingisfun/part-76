Music played for hours out of his fathersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nsanctuary he could literally hear beats playing through the walls! In 1995,\nhe moved to the virgin island he remembersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that as the precise moment he\nwent from casual listener to full fledged fiend. He blasted the volume and\nsoaked every word, every drum. That sample-driven classic boom bap didn't\nerase, but it definitely overpowered any previous musical interests. With a\nknack for words and great respect for storytelling already in place, it\ndidn't take much for him to start fitting together his own rhymes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c52c4ac12111d254416195d95e03759c3cd57d11","amp;dn":"Octoba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c52c4ac12111d254416195d95e03759c3cd57d11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,44,74,193,33,17,210,84,65,97,149,217,94,3,117,156,60,213,125,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
