He also translated many books of Abdolkarim Soroush into Arabic.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/83f55837a2f5bfbfec508d4af83b13cf2d1d6d74.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/83f55837a2f5bfbfec508d4af83b13cf2d1d6d74.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0ac3bf85dd978b7e4534d072351003242801796","amp;dn":"Ahmed+Al-Gubbanchi+-+Batch+%23+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0ac3bf85dd978b7e4534d072351003242801796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,172,59,248,93,217,120,183,228,83,77,7,35,81,0,50,66,128,23,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
