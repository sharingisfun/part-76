I figured if anyone wanted to learn more about it they would come here (which I did when I needed to find books and had no money), so I thank whomever I got the books from (I can't remember your name but THANK YOU!). \n\nI apologize for the slow seeding, my internet connection is rather bad. Once I organize the rest of my music into one folder, I'll probably upload that as well.\n\nThanks,\n\nAsatruer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4efd2b0e032b28000d714fe5f51ec8f16a9a9355","amp;dn":"Asatru+Books+and+Webpage+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4efd2b0e032b28000d714fe5f51ec8f16a9a9355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,253,43,14,3,43,40,0,13,113,79,229,245,30,200,241,106,154,147,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
