It was released on October 22, 2012 through Big Machine Records, as the follow-up to her commercially successful 2010 album Speak Now.[8] It was announced through Swift's live webchat on August 13, 2012, in which she revealed the album title, album cover, as well as answered fan questions. Four promotional singles were released in the month leading up to the album release, three of which debuted inside the top ten of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The album features collaborations with new producers and guest artists such as Gary Lightbody and Ed Sheeran, and sees Swift experimenting with new musical genres.\n\n1.\t&quot;State of Grace&quot;  \tTaylor Swift\tNathan Chapman, Swift\t4:55\n2.\t&quot;Red&quot;  \tSwift\tDann Huff, Nathan Chapman, Swift\t3:43\n3.\t&quot;Treacherous&quot;  \tSwift, Dan Wilson\tWilson\t4:02\n4.\t&quot;I Knew You Were Trouble.&quot;  \tSwift, Max Martin, Shellback\tMartin, Shellback\t3:39\n5.\t&quot;All Too Well&quot;  \tSwift, Liz Rose\tChapman, Swift\t5:29\n6.\t&quot;22&quot;  \tSwift, Max Martin, Shellback\tMartin, Shellback\t3:52\n7.\t&quot;I Almost Do&quot;  \tSwift\tChapman, Swift\t4:04\n8.\t&quot;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together&quot;  \tSwift, Max Martin, Shellback\tMartin, Shellback\t3:13\n9.\t&quot;Stay Stay Stay&quot;  \tSwift\tChapman, Swift\t3:25\n10.\t&quot;The Last Time&quot; (featuring Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol)\tSwift, Lightbody, Jacknife Lee\tLee\t4:59\n11.\t&quot;Holy Ground&quot;  \tSwift\tJeff Bhasker\t3:22\n12.\t&quot;Sad Beautiful Tragic&quot;  \tSwift\tChapman, Swift\t4:44\n13.\t&quot;The Lucky One&quot;  \tSwift\tBhasker\t4:00\n14.\t&quot;Everything Has Changed&quot; (featuring Ed Sheeran)\tSwift, Sheeran\tButch Walker\t4:05\n15.\t&quot;Starlight&quot;  \tSwift\tHuff, Chapman, Swift\t3:40\n16.\t&quot;Begin Again&quot;  \tSwift\tHuff, Chapman, Swift\t3:57\n\n1.\t&quot;The Moment I Knew&quot;  \tSwift\tChapman, Swift\t4:46\n2.\t&quot;Come Back...
