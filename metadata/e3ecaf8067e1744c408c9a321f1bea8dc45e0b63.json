In case youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been not following, one of the worst features of Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition PC is its awfully low-res cut-scenes. Thankfully though, PC gamers can enjoy better videos now with this pack.\n\n\n The whole package is 13GB in size and there are 15 parts that you need to download.\n\n\n As dirtycatch wrote:\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The videos are 720p and almost on par with the PS3 versions quality, Audio is taken from the higher quality PS3 videos too and all languages are included. (English, German, French, Italian and Spanish).Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3ecaf8067e1744c408c9a321f1bea8dc45e0b63","amp;dn":"MK9.PC.Movies.Re-Encode.BIK.720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3ecaf8067e1744c408c9a321f1bea8dc45e0b63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,236,175,128,103,225,116,76,64,140,154,50,31,27,234,141,196,94,11,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
