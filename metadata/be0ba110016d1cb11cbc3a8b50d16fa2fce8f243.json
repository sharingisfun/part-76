As the decades go by, the heirs of each are affected by the machinations of the aliens, culminating with the birth of Allie Keys, the final product of the aliens' experimentation and the key to their future.\n\n\nEpisode 9 John\nMary and group of soldiers enters the UFO to finds some answers and Mary is shown her future by a Alien looking like her grandfather.
