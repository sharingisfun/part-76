However, one of them has had deep-rooted psychological damage due to his experiences during the war, and as his behavior becomes more erratic--and violent--his friend desperately tries to find a way to help him.\n\nUser Review\n\nGlenn Ford was as good as anyone playing an intense psychotic, which he does here in this above-average western. Ford, playing &quot;Col.Owen Devereaux,&quot; gets elected to the position of &quot;judge&quot; right after his distinguished career in the Civil War. Unfortunately, he has mental problems and this position carries too much weight for an unstable sort such as him to be carrying. His best buddy, &quot;Capt. Del Stewart&quot; (William Holden) sees his friend as he is and tries to reason with him and help him out but winds up being alienated, too, by the paranoid judge whose problems escalate as the story goes on.\n\nThere's not a tremendous amount of action in here, but it still moves pretty fast and looks really nice on DVD. This is one of the few color films of the 1940s.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6794653668ea2adeb8f25d5f4d428aaa2eca201","amp;dn":"Man+from+Colarado%2C+The+%28Western%29+%7BG%2C+Ford%2C+Holden%7D+%5B1948%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6794653668ea2adeb8f25d5f4d428aaa2eca201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,121,70,83,102,142,162,173,235,143,37,213,244,212,40,170,162,236,162,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
