But underneath that exterior is a little girl hanging onto the last words her father ever spoke to her. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Make me proud,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he had said. She promised she would...and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done her best over the past seven years with every choice, with every word, with every action.\n\nLivie walks into Princeton with a solid plan, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dead set on delivering on it: Rock her classes, set herself up for medical school, and meet a good, respectable guy that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to someday marry. What isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t part of her plan are Jell-O shots, a lovable, party animal roommate she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say Ã¢â‚¬ËœnoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to, and Ashton, the gorgeous captain of the menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rowing team. Definitely him. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an arrogant ass who makes LivieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s usually non-existent temper flare and everything she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want in a guy. Worse, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friends and roommates with Connor, who happens to fits LivieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s criteria perfectly. So why does she keep thinking about Ashton?\n\nAs Livie finds herself facing mediocre grades, career aspirations she no longer thinks she can handle, and feelings for Ashton that she shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forced to let go of her last promise to her father and, with it, the only identity that she knows.\n\n|------------------------------------------|\n| Go to online-convert.com for conversions.|\n|------------------------------------------|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdad00546fe701d6ad5cd7d29c588f5c5803dd3b","amp;dn":"One+Tiny+Lie+%28Ten+Tiny+Breaths+%232%29+by+K.A.+Tucker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdad00546fe701d6ad5cd7d29c588f5c5803dd3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,173,0,84,111,231,1,214,173,92,215,210,156,88,143,92,88,3,221,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
