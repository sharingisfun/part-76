Using a start-to-finish case study and extensive Java example code, De Jonge covers the entire lifecycle, from application design and data modeling through security, testing, and deployment.\n\n \n\nDe Jonge introduces breakthrough techniques for creating applications that respond within two seconds, even on cold startup, and allow server responses in hundreds of milliseconds or less throughout the rest of the session. He also demonstrates how to avoid common mistakes that can dramatically reduce cloud application performance and scalability. He thoroughly covers state-of-the-art user interface development and shows how to make the most of Google App EngineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive set of APIs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9816e31efeeb3c8000b634ecab05a7ceecaa6c7d","amp;dn":"Essential+App+Engine+Building+High-Performance+Java+Apps+with+Go","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9816e31efeeb3c8000b634ecab05a7ceecaa6c7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,22,227,30,254,235,60,128,0,182,52,236,171,5,167,206,236,170,108,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
