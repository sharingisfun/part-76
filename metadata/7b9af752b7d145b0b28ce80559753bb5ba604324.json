In the process he meets Sylvie Gerard, a local travel agent. Together they form a strong partnership and quite the detective team. However, the local police squad never made it easy so they often require help from their friends: Ian, Spider (owners of the Tropical Heat Bar at different times) and Rollie (local police mortician). The Town of Key Mariah will never be the same again thanks to Nick Slaughter and company. \n\naka Sweating Bullets \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101226/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101226/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy the show, and thanks for choosing cOOt torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b9af752b7d145b0b28ce80559753bb5ba604324","amp;dn":"Tropical+Heat+-+Season+1+%5BDVDRip%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b9af752b7d145b0b28ce80559753bb5ba604324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,154,247,82,183,209,69,176,178,140,232,5,89,117,59,181,186,96,67,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
