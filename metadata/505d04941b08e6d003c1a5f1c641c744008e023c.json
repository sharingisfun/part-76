Jen's bloody war against the Blutes is over and it's time for the cleanup phase of the operation. All's well that ends well? In a word... no. Jen's enemies get a little too close, Jack gets a little too crazy, and it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye! How far is Jen really prepared to go to keep her revenge from wrecking her life, and what happens when the people she loves get in the way? 'If you dug on the messed-up first arc of Jennifer Blood, you should be very happy because the quality and insanity continues. Ewing comes on board and shows our titular heroine isn't just a one-trick pony. He doesn't try to replicate Ennis' run but instead builds gloriously up from it like an ambitious kid making a three story sandcastle with wi-fi and a car wash. The first arc was just the introduction, now we need to see Jennifer reap the blood she worked so hard to sew.\n\nCovers\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/acy7PasB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/acy7PasB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/adnExGsr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/adnExGsr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/abceK7gG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/abceK7gG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/abv9ieAq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/abv9ieAq&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/abysgm6S&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/abysgm6S&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/adbu886S&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/adbu886S&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:505d04941b08e6d003c1a5f1c641c744008e023c","amp;dn":"Garth+Ennis%27+Jennifer+Blood+Vol.+2+%28Digital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"505d04941b08e6d003c1a5f1c641c744008e023c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,93,4,148,27,8,230,208,3,193,165,241,198,65,199,68,0,142,2,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
