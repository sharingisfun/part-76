VLC Media Player is compatible on Windows (tested myself), just make sure you have the latest version.\nIt is not compatible with many devices.\n\nIf this upload goes well, I might as well upload my other 10bit encodes.\n\nYou can use these to keep and save space on your hard drive.\n\nOriginal by: HorribleSubs\nEncoded by: theviki\nRenamed by: theviki\nUploaded by: theviki\n\n\nPlease seed for as long as you can! I don't have a seedbox...\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8be4a1311a09da865b430865fca7e83bc3cf6493","amp;dn":"%5Btheviki%5D+Sword+Art+Online+%5BHi10P%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8be4a1311a09da865b430865fca7e83bc3cf6493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,228,161,49,26,9,218,134,91,67,8,101,252,167,232,59,195,207,100,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
