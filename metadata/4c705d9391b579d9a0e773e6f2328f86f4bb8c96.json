It was posted on YouTube in 12 parts and I ripped the parts off YouTube and combined them all together with Windows Movie Maker. It was only up on YouTube for half a day until they took it down. \n\nMP4, 1 hour and 43 minutes long. \n\nHere's the info from the EPIX Channel's website\n\nEPIX presents the World Premiere Original Documentary, TWA FLIGHT 800, a thought-provoking ninety-minute documentary about the ill-fated Trans World Airline Flight 800 to Paris, France, which exploded on July 17, 1996 just 12 minutes after takeoff from JFK International Airport, killing all 230 people on board.  The special features six former members of the official crash investigation breaking their silence to refute the officially proposed cause of the jetlinerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demise and reveal how the investigation was systematically undermined.  In commemoration of the 17th anniversary of the traumatic event, TWA FLIGHT 800 premieres Wednesday, July 17, 2013 at 8PM ET.  \n\nTWA FLIGHT 800 is written, directed, and produced by Emmy Award-winning journalist Kristina Borjesson.  Co-producer, Dr. Tom Stalcup, PhD, Physics, who for 16 years, was determined to delve deeper into the original investigation to seek truth and closure for the family members of the victims of this tragedy, led the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation. The documentary features interviews with key members of the original TWA 800 Investigation team, including Senior Accident Investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board (Ret.), Hank Hughes (Ret.), Chief Accident Investigator for TWA (Ret.), Bob Young, and Air Line Pilot Association Representative/Investigator James Speer. \n\nTWA FLIGHT 800 is an EPIX Original Documentary. Jeff Sagansky is the executive producer, Kevin Cloutier is the director of photography, and David Jakubovic is the editor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c705d9391b579d9a0e773e6f2328f86f4bb8c96","amp;dn":"TWA+Flight+800+Full+Documentary+Rough+Cut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c705d9391b579d9a0e773e6f2328f86f4bb8c96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,112,93,147,145,181,121,217,160,231,115,230,242,50,143,134,244,187,140,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
