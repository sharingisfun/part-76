The modular C++ class library and developer tools easily enables developers to create applications for one platform and easily build and run to deploy on another platform.\n\nQt 5 continues to offer all of the power of native Qt C++ enabling highly sophisticated user experiences, offering applications the full capabilities of OpenGL/OpenGL ES graphics acceleration. Key benefits include graphics quality improvements, higher performance on constrained hardware, cross-platform portability, support for C++11, HTML5 support with QtWebKit 2, a vastly improved QML engine with new APIs, and ease of use and compatibility with Qt 4 versions.\n\nMore information: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://qt-project.org/qt5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://qt-project.org/qt5&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb80540711b9be76ca7e60fb9f36baa4c3114040","amp;dn":"Qt+5.0.0+for+GNU%2FLinux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb80540711b9be76ca7e60fb9f36baa4c3114040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,128,84,7,17,185,190,118,202,126,96,251,159,54,186,164,195,17,64,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
