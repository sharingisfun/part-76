He has a brother, Anuj. Anuj gets angry at Aditya one day and runs away. ACP Yashwant Thakur helps Aditya in finding Anuj, and later tells him that Anuj was killed in an encounter. Aditya reads a police report, which stated that Anuj was running away with drugs, and was shot dead on the spot. Aditya can't quite believe this so investigates himself. He later meets Ramona, who reveals that ACP Yashwant Thakur and his two other police officers killed Anuj for no apparent reason and lied to cover it up. Aditya wants to take the matter to court and chooses Payal as his lawyer. However, after losing the case, Aditya decides to take matters into his own hands by holding the three until they confess their crime. This was successful and, having secretly recorded this evidence, shows it to the Police Commissioner.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/2486/bardaasht2004dvdrip720pk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/2486/bardaasht2004dvdrip720pk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/264/bardaasht2004dvdrip720p.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwe are onPost Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, AllEncoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers - Contact Us @\n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c7def8289e232b7f8e5fc3d2a6a03e2359f1387","amp;dn":"Bardaasht+%282004%29+DVDRip+720p+x264+Manudil+SilverRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c7def8289e232b7f8e5fc3d2a6a03e2359f1387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,125,239,130,137,226,50,183,248,229,252,61,42,106,3,226,53,159,19,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
