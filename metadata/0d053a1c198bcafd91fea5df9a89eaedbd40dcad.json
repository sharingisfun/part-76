We'd be silly to expect anything different from the show's spinoff program, &quot;Epic Chef,&quot; which pits actual chefs against one another in a gross battle of unconscionable proportions.\n\nThe series' first episode, a breakfast challenge, features celebrity chef David J. Alvarez and the winner of &quot;Top Chef&quot; season two, Ilan Hall. But &quot;Epic Meal Time&quot; host Harley Morenstein clearly isn't impressed by accolades. &quot;That doesn't mean shit here,&quot; he says in the intro.\n\nIn classic &quot;Epic Meal Time&quot; fashion, the ingredients are less than refined. There's &quot;sushi-grade lard,&quot; huge handles of rum, various breakfast meats and an entire suitcase -- yes, a suitcase -- filled with bacon.\n\nMorenstein provides a commentary throughout that would make Alton Brown blush, spouting such gems as, &quot;David's making sex for your mouth,&quot; &quot;The clock is a vicious bitch&quot; and &quot;This isn't a kitchen! It's an internet show.&quot; Morenstein and his panel of celebrity judges, which includes a crass Duff Goldman from &quot;Ace of Cakes,&quot; make sure to take plenty of shots as the chefs cook.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d053a1c198bcafd91fea5df9a89eaedbd40dcad","amp;dn":"Epic+Chef+Episode+1+%28Epic+Meal+Time%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d053a1c198bcafd91fea5df9a89eaedbd40dcad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,5,58,28,25,139,202,253,145,254,165,223,154,137,234,237,189,64,220,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
