We spoke to him about the concept behind his first full length record, and the deeper story behind itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recording.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The album was kind of a document of my learning to sing and write acoustic music. I only started singing just before turning 24, after much turmoil and heartache. That kind of became itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s birth place. The pathos in the album came from a huge depression i was going through at the time. I had to have an outlet to put things and quell a spiraling demonstrative lament. These songs became that outlet. A coping mechanism: Not in that writing them occluded the memory, but having people respond to them at open mics and such gave me a sense that something good could at least be gleamed.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThough the songs on Ã¢â‚¬ËœRaise Our Sunken ShipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ clearly comes from a fairly dark place, it feels like a strangely positive record at heart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ full of redemption and bleakly positive hope, and It covers the length and breadth of AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo career thus far. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The song Ã¢â‚¬ËœRaise Our Sunken ShipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was the first ever recording of me singing, and the version on the album is that very version. I had redone it a year later, but then opted for the older one.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s artwork and even itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release date are all tied to the title of the record and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lead track. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bound to the sentiment of those who died on the Lusitania (Hence Ã¢â‚¬ËœRaise Our Sunken ShipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢). IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not a strong believer in fate, but I am a stronger observer in others tarriance to it, and with that, Raise our Sunken ship became a kind of figurehead for the album. It even got itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s physical release on the anniversary of the sinking of the Lusitania. It set the tone for my songwriting thereafter.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThough this is a very personal record, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect to look straight in to AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s psyche. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really like singing directly about myself. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a whole vanity with that that I get really uncomfortable about. I dabble in the direct from time to time, but only when metaphor wouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve cheapened sentimentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRecorded above a strip club in the consumerised heart of Leicester, The record draws from itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surroundings in indirect ways.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Aside from the Cello and Violin, the album is pretty much just me playing in my bedroom. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a horribly arduious environment to record in at times, but it does take away the impetus of calander and mishap. If somethings wrong itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my fault, so I just stop being a dick and do it again. This means things can stretch out and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to finish from time to time. The environment inevitably informs the song though. You can hear trucks loading, phones going off and all sorts if you listen carefully. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not ideal, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s part of the aesthetic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d4ae37e400978736d557f80b3e9a15ba0ee1fdc","amp;dn":"Weikie+-+Raise+Our+Sunken+Ship+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d4ae37e400978736d557f80b3e9a15ba0ee1fdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,74,227,126,64,9,120,115,109,85,127,128,179,233,161,91,160,238,31,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
