Family heirlooms and found objects with unexpected value and amazing stories just waiting to be discovered. Each episode of America's Lost Treasures will follow our team of two cast members on their quest to find these treasures, uncover their stories, and choose one item that deserves to take its place in a museum. The chosen object each episode will be on loan to the National Geographic Society's special exhibition of America's Lost Treasures, and the object owner will receive a $10,000 award.\n\n\n\n\n5)  Los Angeles \nWith ancient dinosaur fossils, 1920s C-melody saxophones and antique rifles, Curt Doussett and Kinga Philipps have their hands full at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History. It all comes down to a light bulb from the late 1800s, brought by the great-grandson of Thomas Edison's protge; or a 34-star American flag, made before West Virginia became the 35th state in 1863. Though much of the material in the flag is missing, is it enough to be chosen to be exhibited at National Geographic?\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/798/americaslosttreasuressc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/798/americaslosttreasuressc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/798/americaslosttreasuressc.jpg http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/798/americaslosttreasuressc.jpg http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/798/americaslosttreasuressc.jpg http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/798/americaslosttreasuressc.jpg http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/798/americaslosttreasuressc.jpg http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/798/americaslosttreasuressc.jpg http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/798/americaslosttreasuressc.jpg http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/798/americaslosttreasuressc.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2044 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45mins\n * Number Of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/americas-lost-treasures/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a8d33aac1f7adb687c111127fe1b6850661c44","amp;dn":"NG.Americas.Lost.Treasures.05of10.Los.Angeles.PDTV.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a8d33aac1f7adb687c111127fe1b6850661c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,168,211,58,172,31,122,219,104,124,17,17,39,254,27,104,80,102,28,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
