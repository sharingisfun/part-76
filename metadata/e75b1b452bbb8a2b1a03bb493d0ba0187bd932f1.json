One day, Mashiro Shiina - a cute girl who happens to be also a cosmopolitan, brilliant artist - moves into Sakurasou.\n\nSorata thinks to himself that he should protect Mashiro from the weirdos at Sakurasou, but Mashiro has a surprising secret: she has no idea how to take care of herself. She gets lost if she goes out, and her room is a complete mess. Sorata's dorm mates designate him as the &quot;master&quot; of Mashiro, and thus, an ordinary boy and a brilliant girl must live like &quot;a master and his pet.&quot;\n\n\n\nGenres: comedy, drama, romance\n\n\nThemes: school\n\n\nRelease date : November 22, 2012\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75b1b452bbb8a2b1a03bb493d0ba0187bd932f1","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sakurasou+no+Pet+na+Kanojo+-+07+%5B720p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75b1b452bbb8a2b1a03bb493d0ba0187bd932f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,91,27,69,43,187,138,43,26,3,187,73,61,11,160,24,123,217,50,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
