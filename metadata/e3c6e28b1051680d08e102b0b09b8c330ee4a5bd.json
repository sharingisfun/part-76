Features rockin' classics like 'Last In Line', 'Don't Talk To Strangers', 'Rainbow In The Dark', 'Mob Rules', 'Mystery', 'Stand Up &amp; Shout' and more. Holy Diver was the finest hard rock release of 1983 - a stone cold classic from first note to last. And just in case anyone might take it for a fluke or a one-off stroke of genius, the 1984 follow-up,The Last In Line, was pretty spectacular, too. Both concerts feature the original line-up of the band, plus the DVD features the added bonus of a brand new, exclusive interview with Ronnie James Dio, filmed in 2005, where Ronnie he talks in detail about the Holy Diver album, and the background to the project in general. Myth-laden hard rock has never had a better spokesman. Universal. 2005\n\nTracklist:\n\n live in Holland\n1. Stand Up And Shout\n2. Straight Through The Heart\n3. Shame On The Night\n4.
