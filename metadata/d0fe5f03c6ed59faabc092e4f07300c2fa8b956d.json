Its motto is &quot;For men who should know better&quot;. At its peak in the late 1990s it sold over 450,000 copies each month, but by 2012 had collapsed to below 35,000. Between 2003-2006, Loaded won numerous industry awards for design and journalism, including 'best designed fashion pages' at the Magazine Design Awards, for a spread of dogs photographed wearing jewellery. Loaded staff writer Jeff Maysh won five industry awards for journalism, including MJA Feature Writer of the Year, and PTC New Monthly Consumer Journalist of the year.\n\n\n\n                    English | 180 pages | HQ PDF | 131.00 Mb\n\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0fe5f03c6ed59faabc092e4f07300c2fa8b956d","amp;dn":"Loaded+Magazine+UK+January+2013+%5Bazizex666%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0fe5f03c6ed59faabc092e4f07300c2fa8b956d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,254,95,3,198,237,89,250,171,192,146,228,240,115,0,194,250,139,149,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
