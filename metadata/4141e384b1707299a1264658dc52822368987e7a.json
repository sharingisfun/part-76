The series was produced in two stages: Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years 1954Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1964 consists of the first six episodes covering the time period between the Brown v. Board decision and the Selma to Montgomery marches. It was broadcast in 1987 on PBS. The remaining 8 episodes make up Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1985, which was broadcast on PBS in 1990. The series was also shown in the United Kingdom on BBC2.\n\nCreated and executive-produced by Henry Hampton at Blackside, Inc., the series uses primary sources (such as archival footage and interviews with persons involved in the mentioned events) to record the growth of the civil rights movement in the United States, with special focus on the ordinary people who effected the change. It has been lauded for its depiction of the Civil Rights Movement, and used extensively in schools and other educational settings as a way to convey the experiences and struggle for civil rights in America.\n\nThe title of the series is derived from the song &quot;Keep Your Eyes on the Prize&quot;, which is used in each episode as the opening theme music.\n\nEach episode of the series is narrated by Julian Bond. A founding member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Bond emerged as a notable figure in the Civil Rights Movement in 1965 when he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives. The House refused to seat him because he publicly endorsed SNCC's opposition to US involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously ruled that the Georgia House of Representatives had denied Bond his freedom of speech and was required to seat him.\n\nEpisodes and Content\n\nEyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years\n\n1. &quot;Awakenings&quot; (1954Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1956)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMurder of Emmett Till\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMontgomery Bus Boycott\n\n2 . &quot;Fighting Back&quot; (1957Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1962)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCentral High School and the Little Rock Nine\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tJames Meredith and the University of Mississippi\n\n3 . &quot;Ain't Scared of Your Jails&quot; (1960Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1961)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tNashville sit-ins and boycotts\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tFreedom Riders\n\n4. &quot;No Easy Walk&quot; (1961Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1963)\nMartin Luther King, Jr. and . . .\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAlbany, Georgia\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tBirmingham, Alabama\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tThe March on Washington\n\n5. &quot;Mississippi: Is This America?&quot; (1962Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1964)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMedgar Evers\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMurder of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMississippi Freedom Democratic Party\n\n6. &quot;Bridge to Freedom&quot; (1965)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tVoting rights movement in Selma, Alabama\n\nEyes on the Prize: America at the Crossroads\n\n1. &quot;The Time Has Come&quot; (1964Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1966)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMalcolm X\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tLowndes County Freedom Organization\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tThe March Against Fear\n\n2. &quot;Two Societies&quot; (1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1968)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMartin Luther King and Chicago\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tDetroit Riot of 1967\n\n3. &quot;Power!&quot; (1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1968)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tElection of Carl Stokes as Cleveland mayor\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tBirth of the Black Panther Party\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCommunity control of the Ocean Hill-Brownsville school district in Brooklyn\n\n4. &quot;The Promised Land&quot; (1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1968)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tThe final years of Martin Luther King, Jr.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tThe Poor People's Campaign and Resurrection City\n\n5. &quot;Ain't Gonna Shuffle No More&quot; (1964Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1972)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMuhammad Ali\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tThe movement at Howard University\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tNational Black Political Convention\n\n6. &quot;A Nation of Law?&quot; (1968Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1971)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tFred Hampton and the Black Panther Party in Chicago\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAttica Prison rebellion\n\n7. &quot;The Keys to the Kingdom&quot; (1974Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1980)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tBusing and the Boston public school system\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMaynard Jackson and the city of Atlanta\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAllan Bakke and affirmative action\n\n8.&quot;Back to the Movement&quot; (1979Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1983)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMiami Riot of 1980 and preceding events\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tElection of Harold Washington as Chicago mayor and preceding events\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tOverview of the movement and its effect upon the nation and the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4141e384b1707299a1264658dc52822368987e7a","amp;dn":"Eyes+on+the+Prize+I+and+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4141e384b1707299a1264658dc52822368987e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,65,227,132,177,112,114,153,161,38,70,88,220,82,130,35,104,152,126,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
