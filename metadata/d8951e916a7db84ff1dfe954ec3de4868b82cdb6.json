Arthur is determined to rescue his queen, but it will not be easy; she is locked in the Dark Tower, a place that haunts the dreams of men...\n\nArthur and his knights must embark on a quest like no other, battling through a landscape riddled with hidden dangers, perilous obstacles and magical beings. As they near their goal, Merlin's sense of dread reaches breaking point. What twisted game is Morgana playing? And more importantly, just what is the final test that awaits them in the tower?\n\n\nDirector: Ashley Way\nWriter: Jake Michie\nCasts:\n  John Hurt        ...\tThe Dragon (voice)\n  Fintan McKeown   ...\tOdin\n  Katie McGrath    ...\tMorgana\n  Janet Montgomery ...\tPrincess Mithian\n  James Fox        ...\tKing Rodor\n  Rupert Young     ...\tSir Leon\n  Richard Wilson   ...\tGaius\n  Colin Morgan     ...\tMerlin\n  Bradley James    ...\tArthur\n  Angel Coulby     ...\tGwen\n  Adetomiwa Edun   ...\tSir Elyan\n  Eoin Macken      ...\tSir Gwaine\n  Tom Hopper       ...\tSir Percival\n\nPrepared by DNA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8951e916a7db84ff1dfe954ec3de4868b82cdb6","amp;dn":"Merlin.S05E06.720p.WEB.DL.x264-DNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8951e916a7db84ff1dfe954ec3de4868b82cdb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,149,30,145,106,125,184,79,241,223,233,84,236,61,228,134,139,130,205,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
