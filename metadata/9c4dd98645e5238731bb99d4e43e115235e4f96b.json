The ones you'd love to forget but can't help recalling when an old school mate crosses your path? In the far away land of her memory, Jane Salomon too was a school kid, until... She defected to the other camp: the teacher side.\n\nFrom this new vintage point she learned to adapt to the wild and dysfunctional world of secondary education. With a blend of humour and sarcasm, she casts a critical glance at the bizarre and often comical ways those around her operate. Hollywood best thrillers, action movies and romance pale to insignificance next to the topsy-turvy world of school.\n\nWho shot the janitor? How does a teacher unwittingly becomes a drug smuggler? What makes a simple toilet turn into a fully operational head-quarter? And that's only the staff...\n\nConfessions of a teacher offers a witty outlook on what really happens in our schools. Funny and insightful, it will likely put a different spin on what you remember of your school days.
