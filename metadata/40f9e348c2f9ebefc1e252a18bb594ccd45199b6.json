Medical cannabis entrepreneur and Fort Collins dispensary owner Josh Stanley works aggressively to counter such pressure with radio ads and fundraisers.

Jim Gerhardt and fellow officers on the North Metro Task Force continue to find illegal grows by residents claiming to be growing medical marijuana. Is the pendulum swinging back to curb the 10-year proliferation of medical marijuana in Colorado? Find out what happens when a small Colorado town must decide whether or not to legalize a budding industry. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2239097/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2239097/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy the show and thanks for choosing cOOt torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f9e348c2f9ebefc1e252a18bb594ccd45199b6","amp;dn":"American+Weed+-+Season+1+%5BHDTV%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f9e348c2f9ebefc1e252a18bb594ccd45199b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,249,227,72,194,249,235,239,193,226,82,161,139,181,148,204,212,81,153,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
