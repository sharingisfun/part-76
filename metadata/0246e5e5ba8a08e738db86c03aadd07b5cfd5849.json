It seems to hold more emotion and go \ndeeper than words.\n\nMusicians as varied as Emeli Sande, who enthralled the world when she sang at \nthe Olympics, opera diva Jessye Norman, dubstep artist Mala and modern \nclassical composer George Benjamin explain how music makes them feel. Alan \nYentob also talks to a vicar, a psychologist, a Hollywood composer, an adman \nand even the people who choose the music played in shopping malls. He sees \nbabies dance to a rhythm, and old people brought forth out of silence by the \npower of music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0246e5e5ba8a08e738db86c03aadd07b5cfd5849","amp;dn":"BBC+Imagine+-+Winter+2012+How+Music+Makes+Us+Feel+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0246e5e5ba8a08e738db86c03aadd07b5cfd5849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,70,229,229,186,138,8,231,56,219,134,192,58,173,208,123,92,253,88,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
