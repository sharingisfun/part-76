(Superior to the Alpha Video aka Oldies.com version)\n\nRETURN OF THE APE MAN comes from the Sinister Cinema DVD-R\n\nPlease be aware that RETURN OF THE APE MAN is NOT a sequel to THE APE MAN. It has a new story, different director, different writer . . . \n\nNevertheless, it seems natural to offer these two Monogram oldies in one sterling package.\n\nEnjoy and share please.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d6231eda5e7f79e6519807bfff1b74b9ca6808","amp;dn":"Poverty+Row+Ape+Man+Double+Feature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d6231eda5e7f79e6519807bfff1b74b9ca6808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,214,35,30,218,94,127,121,230,81,152,7,191,255,27,116,185,202,104,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
