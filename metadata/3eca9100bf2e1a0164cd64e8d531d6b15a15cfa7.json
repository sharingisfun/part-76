Begushkin - In The Yard (03:13)\n\nKudos to Begushkin--aka Brooklynite Dan Smith and his friends--for making an album of adventurous folk that breaks out of British Isles modal drone apery. With exquisitely played guitar lines, hints of Balkan gypsy sounds, and a voice that recalls both Will Oldham and John Cale, Smith has delivered an eerie thriller of a record centered exclusively on--as the title suggests--goings-on between sundown and sunrise. The strength of his material aside, Smith is one talented band leader: throughout NIGHTLY THINGS he conducts a shifting array of friends and players into one unified, enchantingly gothic neo-folk beast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eca9100bf2e1a0164cd64e8d531d6b15a15cfa7","amp;dn":"Begushkin+-+Nightly+Things+%5B2007%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eca9100bf2e1a0164cd64e8d531d6b15a15cfa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,202,145,0,191,46,26,1,100,205,100,232,213,49,214,177,90,21,207,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
