The Cravet family builds their newspaper Oklahoma Wigwam into a business empire and Yancey Cravet is the adventurer-idealist who, to his wife's anger, spurns the opportunity to become governor since this means helping to defraud the native Americans of their land and resources.\n\n\nUser Review\n\nCIMARRON didn't do well at the box-office, and what a pity. Then again, it's the story of a man who was considered to be a failure in life by those who knew him, yet, when you look at him, Yancey Cravat was the most successful man around. It took me several viewings of the film to recognize this, and for that, I'm ashamed of myself.\n\nThe 1931 version is more faithful to Edna Ferber's novel. However, this version, which contains one of Glenn Ford's best performances, is more entertaining, and has an outstanding Franz Waxman score. It's the tale of a man who lives by his own personal code, living by his conscience, and suffers the consequences for it.\n\nCIMARRON is a film that cries to be seen in widescreen, and hopefully gets such a release in DVD. Until then, TCM is the place to watch it. Anthony Mann went from making westerns to epics, and with this film, he was in the best of both worlds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:479b4239a84b77d956f1f5a6737599f2674e6f74","amp;dn":"Cimarron+%28Western%29+%7BGlenn+Ford%2C+Maria+Schell%2C+Anne+Baxter%7D+%5B1960","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"479b4239a84b77d956f1f5a6737599f2674e6f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,155,66,57,168,75,119,217,86,241,245,166,115,117,153,242,103,78,111,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
