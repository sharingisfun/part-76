Viktor Reznov will reportedly return in this section of the game, and it has been suggested that his friendship with Mason will continue to be explored.\nThis portion of the game chronicles the rise of Raul Menendez, the primary antagonist of the game in the 2025 chapter.\nKnown locations in this section are Angola, Afghanistan, Panama and parts of Central America.\n\nIn 2025, a cyberattack targets the Chinese economy, crippling the Chinese Stock Exchange. In retaliation for this, the Chinese government has banned the export of rare earth elements, sparking a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Second Cold WarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ between the United States and the PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Republic of China. During an invasion of Los Angeles, David Mason Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the son of Alex Mason Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a team from the United States Navy Special Warfare Development Group must escort the American and French presidents to safety as they come under attack from automated weapons and MenendezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s men.\nIn the time since the 1980s, Raul Menendez has styled himself as the leader of the Cordis Die, a populist faction hailed as the champions of victims of economic inequality. In his role as their leader, Menendez has taken control of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“keysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the armed forces, hijacking the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ automated weapons systems and turning them against their masters.\nMeanwhile, it is revealed that Frank Woods has survived his encounter with Lev Kravchenko and escaped from Hanoi. He has taken refuge in a secret location known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“The VaultÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and has anticipated MenendezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise to prominence. Woods serves as the narrator for the 2025 story arc.\nKnown locations are Los Angeles, The Vault, Singapore, Yemen and Cayman Trench.\n\nSYSTEM REQ\n\nMinimum\n\nOperating system: SP2 or Windows 7\nCPU: Intel Core2 Duo E8200 2.66 GHz or AMD Phenom X3 8750 2.4 GHz\nMemory: 1.0GB RAM Windows XP/Vista/7/8\nRam: 2GB for 32-bit OS or 4GB for 64-bit OS\nDX: Direct X10\nVGA: Nvidia GeForce 8800GT 512 MB or ATI Radeon HD 3870 512 MB\nSound: DirectX 9.0c Compatible\nHard Drive: At least 20GB of free space\nNetwork: 1Mbps DSL or faster Internet connection\nRecommended System Requirements\n\nOperating System: Windows 7 SP1 64-bit\nCPU: 3GHz Intel Core 2 Quad / 3 GHz AMD Phenom II X4\nRAM: 4GB RAM\nHard Drive: At least 20GB of free space\nVGA: NVidia GTX 560 1024 MB VRAM or better / ATI Radeon 6950 1024MB VRAM\nDirectX : DirectX 11\nNetwork : 1Mbps DSL or faster Internet connection\nSUPPORTED CHIPSETS\n\nNVIDIA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ GeForce 8600 GT / 9 / 100 / 200 / 300 / 400 / 500 / 600 series or better\nAMD/ATI Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Radeon HD 3870 / 4000 / 5000 / 6000 / 7000 series or better ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3a3cf0c67aab045c0a3fb890fc534cfd76e15dd","amp;dn":"Call+of+Duty+Black+Ops+II%2BUpdate3.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3a3cf0c67aab045c0a3fb890fc534cfd76e15dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,163,207,12,103,170,176,69,192,163,251,137,15,197,52,207,215,110,21,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
