Users are encouraged to send feedback to the project so that their ideas can be used to improve Linux Mint.\nBased on Debian and Ubuntu, it provides about 30,000 packages and one of the best software managers.\nIt's safe and reliable. Thanks to a conservative approach to software updates, a unique Update Manager and the robustness of its Linux architecture, Linux Mint requires very little maintenance (no regressions, no antivirus, no anti-spyware...etc).\n\nLinux Mint 15 is the most ambitious release since the start of the project. MATE 1.6 is greatly improved and Cinnamon 1.8 offers a ton of new features, including a screensaver and a unified control center. The login screen can now be themed in HTML5 and two new tools, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Software SourcesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Driver ManagerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, make their first appearance in Linux Mint.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baf9724fdb66654d86c47ca8ce3c0b25521d9223","amp;dn":"Linux+Mint+15+%26quot%3BOlivia%26quot%3B+-+MATE+%2864-bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baf9724fdb66654d86c47ca8ce3c0b25521d9223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,249,114,79,219,102,101,77,134,196,124,168,206,60,11,37,82,29,146,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
