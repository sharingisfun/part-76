As a \nnation, we take them for granted, assuming that they have always existed as \nthey are now. But unpick each of these eating rituals, trace their lineage back \nthrough a thousand years of British history and you find fascinating and \nsurprising stories of social upheaval and shifting class structures, of \ntechnological developments and gastronomic revolutions.\n\nThe origins of breakfast are the most mysterious of all. We all understand what \nwe mean by a 'proper breakfast', but the particulars of our first meal of the \nday have changed dramatically over the centuries. From the earliest records of \nchoirboys at St Paul's breaking their night's fast with bread and ale, through \nthe heavily-laden morning tables of Jane Austen's era and the Edwardian age to \ntoday's mass-produced packet cereals, our breakfasts have been profoundly \ninfluenced by religious strictures, ideas of social status and, of course, the \nopinions of those self-appointed experts who claim to know what is best for us.\n\nSome of our historic breakfast specialities, like plover's eggs in aspic, deep \nfried Dover sole or, Edward VII's favourite, a hollowed-out onion filled with \nchicken livers, cream and brandy, are now long-forgotten. Other present-day \nstaples were accidental inventions. The combination of bacon and eggs came into \nbeing as an unintended consequence of the medieval Church's rules on fasting \nduring Lent. Centuries later, Dr Kellogg discovered the secret to making \ncornflakes only after he mistakenly left his recipe to go mouldy - and Clarissa \njoins in on a recreation of the original experiment that produced the very \nfirst breakfast flake.\n\nAs she charts the evolution of our morning meal across the centuries and the \norigins of our best-known breakfast ingredients, Clarissa uncovers a story of \nlost traditions, culinary discoveries and extraordinary excess.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4650ea97019e64049e2fb3ac79d5b58707e04229","amp;dn":"BBC+Breakfast%2C+Lunch+And+Dinner+1+of+3+Breakfast+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4650ea97019e64049e2fb3ac79d5b58707e04229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,80,234,151,1,158,100,4,158,47,179,172,121,213,181,135,7,224,66,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
