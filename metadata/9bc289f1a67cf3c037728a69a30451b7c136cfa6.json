The Harland and Wolff shipyard has been handed the greatest project in its history. It will build a great, unsinkable ship. And it will be called the RMS Titanic.\n\n&quot;Titanic: Blood &amp; Steel&quot; is the untold story of the building of a legend, and the many lives it affected during its 3-year construction. To its wealthy investors, it was a dream. To the middle class who oversaw the project, it was a challenge. But to the working class who built it, Titanic was the start of a revolution. With Ireland under British rule, and theProtestant and Catholic struggle intensifying, Titanic was more than a shipÃ¢â‚¬Â¦it was a symbol of ambition, hope and unity.\n\nFeaturing an internationally-acclaimed cast including Sir Derek Jacobi (The King's Speech), Chris Noth (Sex and the City), Alessandra Mastronardi (Woody Allen's To Rome With Love), Kevin Zegers (Frozen) and Neve Campbell (Scream), &quot;Titanic: Blood &amp; Steel&quot; is a powerful tale of love and insurrection in the heart of Belfast.\n\nStarring: Sir Derek Jacobi, Chris Noth, Alessandra Mastronardi, Kevin Zegers, Neve Campbell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bc289f1a67cf3c037728a69a30451b7c136cfa6","amp;dn":"Titanic+-+Blood+and+Steel+%5BS01E06%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bc289f1a67cf3c037728a69a30451b7c136cfa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,194,137,241,166,124,243,192,55,114,138,105,163,4,81,183,193,54,207,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
