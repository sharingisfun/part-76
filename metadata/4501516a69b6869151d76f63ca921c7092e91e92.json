Their pure, homegrown folk emanates beauty of all kinds, showcasing an elegant and delicate songwriting style as well as get-up-and-dance vocal harmonies and pure musicianship most could only hope to accomplish.\n\nThis is genuine folk music; the melodies are gorgeous, and DannyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gritty, wholesome vocal style sets Laish apart from so many artists trying to capture a folksy magic reserved only for the most talented of musicians. From the opening tips of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSong On A TransitionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ all the way through to the melodic endings of Ã¢â‚¬ËœA Happy AccidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Laish are brilliant. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unsurprisingly that these wondrous musical creatures Laish call songs are so moreish Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the five band members lend their talents to everybody from Laura Marling to The Leisure Society to Sons of Noel &amp; Adrian when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not self-booking tours, self-releasing albums and playing all over Europe and the UK. LaishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut is incredibly accomplished. This is real, beautiful, honest, gracious and just plain wonderful music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4501516a69b6869151d76f63ca921c7092e91e92","amp;dn":"Laish+-+Laish+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4501516a69b6869151d76f63ca921c7092e91e92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,1,81,106,105,182,134,145,81,215,111,99,202,146,28,112,146,233,30,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
