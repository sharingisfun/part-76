Many things such as Burt the Turtle who was the figurehead the &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; campaign are featured. Along with these film clips are portions of Army training films and demonstration films concerning atomic testing. All of these clips are combined to show how little the experts knew about atomics at the time. And even more to the heart, the point is to show the extent propaganda was used to mollify the fears of the American public, and her soldiers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4fc8511dfb75478ff3dd10b66827cd87a95256","amp;dn":"The+Atomic+Cafe+%281982%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4fc8511dfb75478ff3dd10b66827cd87a95256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,79,200,81,29,251,117,71,143,243,221,16,182,104,39,205,135,169,82,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
