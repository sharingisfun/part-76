First, bear witness to a reunion of Mermaid Man's Golden Age team, the Aquatic Adventurers, in a story we could only call &quot;Lo, There Shall Be a Catered Event,&quot; featuring funky flashbacks by Jerry Ordway (Superman)!  Then, SpongeBob and Patrick's game of superheroes goes from silly to sillier, when they encounter the quiet-loving super-fiend known only as Mendu! Who could this green, big-nosed, tentacled villain possibly be?  Next, legendary Silver Age artist Ramona Fradon (Metamorpho) returns to SpongeBob Comics to draw the never-before-seen Mermaid Man classic &quot;Sidekick Blues,&quot; featuring the sinister Controlling Conch and the rarely sighted Edwardian Age Mermaid Man.  All this plus a tour of the Mermalair, Plankton and Gary's brief super-careers, spoofs of classic comic book ads, and a double-page spread depicting every Bikini Bottom superhero and villain! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae0dcf4d1e924845fe3ef2a009d300c40dedd86d","amp;dn":"Spongebob+Annual+Giant+Swimtacular+1+%28PDF%29+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae0dcf4d1e924845fe3ef2a009d300c40dedd86d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,13,207,77,30,146,72,69,254,62,242,160,9,211,0,196,13,237,216,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
