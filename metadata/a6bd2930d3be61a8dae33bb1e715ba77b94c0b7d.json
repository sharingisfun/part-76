Mr Trower is a conscionable whistle-blower who lectures around the world on hidden dangers from microwave weapons and every-day microwave technologies such as mobile-phones and WiFi. Mr Trower has also repeatedly assisted the UK Police Fedration in their struggle to protect police officers from Tetra/Air-Band radio-communications systems that are harmful to health.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.waterwarcrimes.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.waterwarcrimes.com/&lt;/a&gt; As producer Michael Braverman announced yesterday, what was once an episode just dealing with schemes to profit off the Great Lakes has now expanded into a startling exposÃƒÂ© of the dangerous toxins being added to our water by design. Now known as the Worldwide Water Conspiracy, tonight's episode of Conspiracy Theory with Gov. Jesse Ventura will take on water privatization, false scarcity profit schemes, the effects of fluoride, lithium and uranium in drinking water and much more. WORLDWIDE WATER CONSPIRACY PREMIERES TONIGHT, FRIDAY DEC. 3 AT 10 PM EST / 9 PM CST.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDocumentary - Free Energy - Peter Lindemann - Tesla's Radiant Energy - ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference (2006):\nIn the late 1880's, trade journals in the electrical sciences were predicting free electricity and free energy in the near future. Incredible discoveries about the nature of electricity were becoming common place. Nikola Tesla was demonstrating &quot;wireless lighting&quot; and other wonders associated with high frequency currents. There was an excitement about the future like never before.\n\nWithin 20 years, there would be automobiles, airplanes, movies, recorded music, telephones, radio, and practical cameras. The Victorian Age was giving way to something totally new. For the first time in history, common people were encouraged to envision a utopian future filled with abundant modern transportation and communication, as well as jobs, housing and food for everyone. Disease would be conquered, and so would poverty. Life was getting better, and this time, everyone was going to get a piece of the pie. So, what happened? In the midst of this technological explosion, where did the energy breakthroughs go? Was all of this excitement about free energy, which happened just before the beginning of the last century, just wishful thinking that &quot;real science&quot; eventually disproved?\n\nActually, the answer to that question is no. In fact, the opposite is true. Spectacular energy technologies were developed right along with the other breakthroughs. Since that time, multiple methods for producing vast amounts of energy at extremely low cost have been developed. None of these technologies have made it to the consumer market as an article of commerce, however. Exactly why this is true will be discussed shortly....\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHeavy Watergate:\nThe original title of this documentary is : &quot;Heavy Watergate : The War Against Cold Fusion&quot;.\nOn March 23rd 1989, two respected chemists makes an announcement that rocks the world of science. Heavy water, readily available in the oceans, is used in tabletop experiments that yield enormous amounts of heat energy. Appropriately named &quot;cold fusion&quot;, this purported breakthrough challenges many basic scientific concepts. In response, the gatekeepers of &quot;official science&quot;, heavily reliant upon government funding for their hot fusion research, level an unprecedented smear campaign against the entire field of cold fusion science. Was their discovery of &quot;fire from water&quot; too good to be true ?. Or was it the discovery of the millennium ?.\n\nOf interest to 9-11 researchers, Dr. Stephen &quot;Thermite&quot; Jones was the shill involved with the subversion of Cold Fusion early on as is documented in this 1994 documentary. This is why I knew that the main parts of the so called '9-11 Truth Movement' had been hijaced by shills early on. There were probably only 1 in 10 who were not &quot;controlled opposition&quot;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Invisible Machine  Electromagnetic Warfare:\nImagine the future Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a strange new weapon is detonated high over a large city. There is no explosion, no visible destruction, but everything electronic within the range of this weapon will go outÃ¢â‚¬Â¦permanently.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNWO Nanobots aka Smart Dust:\n&quot;Smart Dust&quot; is an emerging technology made up from tiny, wireless sensors or &quot;motes&quot;. Eventually, these devices will be smart enough to talk with other sensors yet small enough to fit on the head of a pin. Each mote is a tiny computer with a power supply, one more sensors and communications system (HSU, Kahn and Pister 1998, p. 1).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS    \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6bd2930d3be61a8dae33bb1e715ba77b94c0b7d","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Wars+and+Rumors+of+Wars+-+26+-+Secret+Scalar+%28Earthquake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6bd2930d3be61a8dae33bb1e715ba77b94c0b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,189,41,48,211,190,97,168,218,227,59,177,231,21,186,119,185,76,11,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
