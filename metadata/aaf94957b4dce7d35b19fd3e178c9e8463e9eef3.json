Hence this updated version was made due to the release of additional facts \nfrom mob members who served time in prison.\n\nSTORYLINE:\n\nRise of the Footsoldier follows the inexorable rise of Carlton Leach from one of the most feared generals of the football terraces to becoming a member of a notorious gang of criminals who rampaged their way through London and Essex in the late eighties and early nineties. It is three decades of his life following him from football hooliganism, through to his burgeoning career as a bouncer, his involvement in the criminal aspects of the early 'rave' scene and subsequently to his rise to power as one of the most feared and respected criminals in the country. \n\n\nUPLOADERS NOTES:\n\nI remember hearing news of this criminal tail from the media and also additional \nrumours were spread around the underworld that reached all corners of the UK. I will soon be uploading the original movie &quot;Ther Essex Boys&quot; that was made 3 years after the final event. It is very interesting to watch both movies in either order to get a picture of how the the unsolved murders were portrayed in different lights.\n\nEnjoy it.\n\ncheublawm\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf94957b4dce7d35b19fd3e178c9e8463e9eef3","amp;dn":"RISE+OF+THE+FOOTSOLDIER+%5B2007%5D+by+cheublawm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf94957b4dce7d35b19fd3e178c9e8463e9eef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,249,73,87,180,220,231,211,91,25,253,62,23,140,158,132,99,233,238,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
