Designed for Windows XP and above, it offers easy and powerful ways of making backups of your important files and folders.\n\nSecond Copy arranges your backup needs in sets of &quot;profiles.&quot; Each profile is a set of file and folder specifications which tells Second CopyÃ‚Â®, what you want to be copied, to where, and when. Once configured, Second CopyÃ‚Â® monitors the &quot;source&quot; folders for changes or updates and copies new or changed files to the &quot;destination&quot;. This process is done unobtrusively in the background.\n\nSecond Copy includes an easy to use profile wizard that guides you through the setup process. The setup process is separated into Express and Custom modes. In Express mode, you answer three simple questions (what, where and when) about the files to be backed up.\n\nAdvanced users can use the Custom setup option to define specific files to be included in or excluded from the copy. They can also choose how the files are to be copied, e.g. compression, synchronization etc.\n\nThe compression option also offers up to 256-bit AES Encryption. Files can be copied using FTP. Second CopyÃ‚Â® can send an e-mail notification after running the backup. \n\nSecond Copy is a full 32-bit multi-threaded program which lets you tailor the performance by controlling the priority of the background processes. \n\nSupported OS:\n\n(for XP/2003/Vista/7/2008 - 32-bit and 64-bit)\n\nHomepage: http://www.secondcopy.com/index.html\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n1.

Done, Enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a026961667e9d3398f5b6835514c18d6ca95fbf4","amp;dn":"Second+Copy+v8.1.1.0+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a026961667e9d3398f5b6835514c18d6ca95fbf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,38,150,22,103,233,211,57,143,91,104,53,81,76,24,214,202,149,251,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
