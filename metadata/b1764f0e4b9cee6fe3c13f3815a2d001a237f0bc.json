For 10 years they are missing presumed dead, but in May 2013, miraculously, they are discovered alive, one of them with a six-year old daughter. Their captor, Ariel Castro, is now charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. He may even face the death penalty if prosecutors successfully argue that he forcibly caused his captors to miscarry their unborn babies.\nRick Edwards investigates how the victims could disappear from the same area and be held prisoners in the basement of a nearby house with no-one knowing anything about it for a decade. He goes to the address in Seymour Avenue to speak to neighbours and relatives of the accused, interviews people who responded to a woman's cry for help and hears how they made the amazing discovery.\nFeaturing 3-D graphics of the house, showing where the women were kept and how they were moved around to avoid being discovered by visitors, this documentary attempts to provide the most complete picture yet of a case that has shocked the world.\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nCheck there screens for Quality:\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n\n[http://image.bayimg.com/af0b7c9f43b0b5107d193b558f36bdd4e3b14df0.jpg]\n\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                          Video and Audio Specification:\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n\n*** General Parameters ***\n- Name:  The.Cleveland.Captives.What.Really.Happened.HDTV.x264-HYSTERiCAL.mp4 \n- Container:  MP4 - QuickTime \n- Size:  642.78 MB \n- Duration:  57mn 5s \n- Bitrate:  1 502 Kbps \n\n*** Video Track Parameters ***\n- Format:  H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \n- Bitrate:  Max.: --- / Average: 1 404 Kbps / Min.: --- \n- Frame rate (fps):  Max.: --- / Average: 25.000 / Min.: --- \n- Encoding profile:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d499b5bdba9498e7fae4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n- Image size:  832*468 \n- Pixel Aspect Ratio:  Undefined \n- Display Aspect Ratio:  16:9 \n- Interlacing:  Progressive \n\n*** First Audio Track Parameters ***\n- Format:  AAC - MPEG-4 audio \n- Bitrate:  96.0 Kbps \n- Resolution:  Undefined \n- Rate:  48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz \n- Channel(s):  2 (stereo) \n- Position:  Front: L R \n\n*** Miscellaneous ***\n- Subtitle(s): INCLUDED IN FOLDER\n- Album: The Cleveland Captives\n- Performer: BBC Three\n- Genre: Factual\n- Encoded date: Undefined\n- Album artist: Undefined","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1764f0e4b9cee6fe3c13f3815a2d001a237f0bc","amp;dn":"The.Cleveland.Captives.What.Really.Happened.HDTV.x264-HYSTERiCAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1764f0e4b9cee6fe3c13f3815a2d001a237f0bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,118,79,14,75,156,238,111,227,193,63,56,21,162,208,1,162,55,240,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
