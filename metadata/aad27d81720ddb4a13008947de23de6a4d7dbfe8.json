The petitions have received a combined number of signatures totaling over a million.\n\nDuring his nationwide broadcast today, Jones laid out the battle plan for secession, emphasizing that states must first secede from the federal government, which has gone rogue, and then use the terms of the Declaration of Independence to restore the Republic, not create a new country.\n\nJones stressed that he was calling for a cultural restoration in the spirit of the bill of rights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a newly unified America under the Constitution Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and not a violent overthrow, noting that it was the states that created the Constitution and the federal government in the first place.\n\nJones noted that the only course to restoring liberty was clear Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“To follow the founding document of the Republic, the Declaration of Independence, wherein it is clearly stated that it is the right and the duty of the American people, when their government becomes destructive and tyrannical, to abolish and reconstitute it in a form that protects our liberties.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We are not calling for secession to form new separate countries, we are calling for secession because the states created the Constitution, bill of rights and federal government, and the federal government itself has been hijacked by foreign special interests Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mainly banking cartels,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Jones.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aad27d81720ddb4a13008947de23de6a4d7dbfe8","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Calls+For+Second+American+Revolution+dvdrip++2012.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aad27d81720ddb4a13008947de23de6a4d7dbfe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,210,125,129,114,13,219,74,19,0,137,71,222,35,222,106,77,125,191,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
