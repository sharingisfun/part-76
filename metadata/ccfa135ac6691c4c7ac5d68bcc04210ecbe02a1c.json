Concert consisted of a performance of the Fantasy for piano, chorus and orchestra in C minor op. 80 and the Symphonie #9 Op. 125 in D minor. This was a superb performance, on which young conductor lead Osidem by memory (not reading the score) and reading in full detail this masterpiece, which was performance on a historic character, such it was performed as a Period instrument orchestra, which means no vibrato and tempi more close to those whishing by the composer.
