One day, he faints at the hospital and awakens to find himself transported back in time to the Edo period. He is soon attacked by a samurai, but he escapes with the help of a man named Kyotaro. Kyotaro suffers a serious injury to the head while trying to protect him, but Jin manages to save his life despite a lack of proper medical equipment. Because of that, Kyotaro's sister Saki begins taking an interest in Jin and becomes his assistant. Meanwhile, Jin is determined to find a way back to the present.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6af5761e741cdb41d468934f8966aedd35cf831","amp;dn":"Jin+Season+1+%5BJDrama%5D+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6af5761e741cdb41d468934f8966aedd35cf831","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,175,87,97,231,65,205,180,29,70,137,52,248,150,106,237,211,92,248,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
