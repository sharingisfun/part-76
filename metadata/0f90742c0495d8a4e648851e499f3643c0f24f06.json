The time has come to dig it up! This Christmas everyone will believe in Santa Claus. \n\n\nIt was made in Finland. Santa Claus is a big, horrible, ugly creature, I guess. You only see his tentacles. But it is not a horror film. I don't even like horror films, but I liked this film...a lot. I hard-coded it in English, because...except for the beginning, it is in Finnish. \nEnjoy. And don't forget to seed. Thanks. \nH2oDragon.
