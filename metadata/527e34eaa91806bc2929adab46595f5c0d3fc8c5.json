Used a different software this time, came out clean. Also the quality is a bit lower than I'd like, not sure if it's the codec, probably the rain causing too many changes on screen. In the future I'll use a higher bitrate for races with a lot of rain.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:527e34eaa91806bc2929adab46595f5c0d3fc8c5","amp;dn":"F1+-+2012+-+Brazil+-+Race+%28US+Broadcast%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"527e34eaa91806bc2929adab46595f5c0d3fc8c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,126,52,234,169,24,6,188,41,41,173,171,70,89,95,92,13,63,200,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
