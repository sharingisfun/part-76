The four quadrants emerge from the quintessence, and in reflection the quintessence emerges from the four quadrants when actively awakened.\n\nThe quintessence is the spirit in matter which animates us and inspires our curiosity about our place in reality. The four elements and four ethers combine to make seven stages, reflected in our chakras and our connections to the alchemical seven planets and noble metals.\n\nAre we two legged cows to be grazed on genetically disrupted foods and enslaved by debt-based currencies? Or can we experience an awakened emergence from the eternal void, traversing ancient symbol streams as they manifest in reality around us?\n\nHere we discover our path through Quaternity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98fa0a83ce021bb1b86da8fc329b73918a3c2882","amp;dn":"Quaternity+-+Thomas+Joseph+Brown+%5B720p+mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98fa0a83ce021bb1b86da8fc329b73918a3c2882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,250,10,131,206,2,27,177,184,109,168,252,50,155,115,145,138,60,40,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
