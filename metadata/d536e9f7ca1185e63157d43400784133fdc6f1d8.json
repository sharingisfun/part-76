But as Private Investigator and former FBI field agent Will Hogarth is soon to discover, the truth is not always as simple as it appears. The cleanup in New Orleans is riddled with corruption, and the criminals involved will do anything they can to line their pockets. Now in a race against time Will Hogarth must thrust himself deep into the seedy underbelly of the post-Katrina Big EasyÃ¢â‚¬â€ a land where corruption, greed, and senseless murders are all in a dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d536e9f7ca1185e63157d43400784133fdc6f1d8","amp;dn":"The+Telltale+Tempest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d536e9f7ca1185e63157d43400784133fdc6f1d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,54,233,247,202,17,133,230,49,87,212,52,0,120,65,51,253,198,241,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
