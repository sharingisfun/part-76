Back in harness are Johnny_Depp as Officer Tom Hanson, Peter DeLuise as Officer Doug Penhall (less chubby and comical and more &quot;buff&quot; and action-prone than in the series' maiden season), Holly_Robinson as Officer Judy Hoffs, and Dustin_Nguyen as Officer Harry Truman Ioki. And as before, the team takes its orders from no-nonsense police captain Adam Fuller (Steven_Williams). This year's crop of guest stars is an impressive one, including Lynne_Moody, Marcia_Rodd, former Adam-12 leading man Kent McCord (as Tom Hanson's father), and a young Brad_Pitt, cast as a popular high schooler who inexplicably commits suicide. Among the season's top episodes are the two-part &quot;Besieged,&quot; in which the team swoops down upon a deadly crack ring and also attempts to expose a rogue cop, and &quot;Christmas in Saigon,&quot; in which viewers learns the real name of Vietnam refugee H.T. Ioki. Season two ends on a semi-cliffhanger, as the LAPD higher-ups consider the possibility of disbanding the Jump Street team.\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092312/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092312/&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Jump_Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Jump_Street&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n\n\nPlease Review, and Rate.
