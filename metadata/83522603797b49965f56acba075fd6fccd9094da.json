And more importantly, the bug appears at the very moment an autosave is created by the game which makes any further progress impossible. The last autosave will be corrupted. If the game has not been cracked at the very start, there's not problem to do so afterwards.\n\nBUT the last autosave at &quot;Depot&quot; should not be started because the game will not load.  Instead of this, the level &quot;Depot&quot; should be launched from the beggining - through the load option. After the application of the crack and loading the &quot;Depot&quot; level this problem seizes to exist.\n\n\nP.S. The above-stated problem occurs only if the game hasn't been cracked at the beginning for some reason.\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83522603797b49965f56acba075fd6fccd9094da","amp;dn":"METRO+2033+2xDVD5%5BGENTi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83522603797b49965f56acba075fd6fccd9094da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,82,38,3,121,123,73,150,95,86,172,186,7,95,214,252,205,144,148,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
