He also translated many books of Abdolkarim Soroush into Arabic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a73b4c3ebc29f283315a78c9f1c11f280966e18","amp;dn":"Ahmed+Al-Gubbanchi+-+Batch+%2305","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a73b4c3ebc29f283315a78c9f1c11f280966e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,115,180,195,235,194,159,40,51,21,167,140,159,28,17,242,128,150,110,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
