With a large preview panel right in the main window showing you modifications in real time, Windows 7 Boot Updater provides two different elements to modify: booting and resuming.\n\nOrganized in tabs for quick editing, each of the two features comes with its very own pack of settings, regardless if we're talking about text and colors.\n\nFor example, booting can be customized either with a static image or an animation, a new background color, but also with new messages to be displayed below the animation. The messages also support further customization, with available options including font color, position and font size.\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“ResumingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tab comes with the exact same configuration options, so you may spend some time setting up the program.\n\nAdditionally, Windows 7 Boot Updater provides multiple dedicated tools to load and save boot skins, but also a separate feature to create a boot skin installer and thus install a new boot package on another computer without too much effort.\n\nWindows 7 Boot Updater runs on low resources but, just like its name suggests, it's only addressed to Windows 7 workstations, so administrator privileges are needed to make modifications.\n\nAll in all, Windows 7 Boot Updater is a handy Windows tweaking tool and it provides a very user friendly environment to allow users modify the boot screen of their operating system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f89c1395faf5bb86db40b9457aef92feb482bd8","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Boot+Updater","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f89c1395faf5bb86db40b9457aef92feb482bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,137,193,57,95,175,91,184,109,180,11,148,87,174,249,47,235,72,43,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
