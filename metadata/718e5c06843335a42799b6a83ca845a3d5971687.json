He also translated many books of Abdolkarim Soroush into Arabic.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718e5c06843335a42799b6a83ca845a3d5971687","amp;dn":"Ahmed+Al-Gubbanchi+-+Batch+%23+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718e5c06843335a42799b6a83ca845a3d5971687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,142,92,6,132,51,53,164,39,153,182,168,60,168,69,163,213,151,22,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
