Other parts of I Hear a Symphony seem to take its title track almost literally, with the inclusion of the majestic &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; and the Bach-based &quot;A Lover's Concerto&quot;; the latter, in particular, is a Diana Ross tour de force, with very sweetly understated accompaniment by Wilson and Ballard. And elsewhere, Berry Gordy was pushing his vision of the Supremes as a mainstream pop trio, covering &quot;A Stranger in Paradise,&quot; &quot;With a Song in My Heart,&quot; &quot;Without a Song,&quot; and &quot;Wonderful, Wonderful.&quot; None of these are bad, but neither are they terribly distinguished -- the group even adds a certain fresh sparkle to &quot;Wonderful, Wonderful,&quot; but realistically, people were paying their money for the Holland-Dozier-Holland and Eddie Holland-authored songs, any of which would have made about as fine singles as anything the trio ever put out, and all of which are still a chunk of the best part of the group's legacy.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n01.
