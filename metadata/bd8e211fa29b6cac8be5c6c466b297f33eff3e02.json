Many classic arcade shooters have aged incredibly well due to their addictive jump-shoot-dodge cycle complemented by varied level, enemy, and boss design. There are few modern games that can stand beside those classics.\n\nThese days the genre is used for flawed experiments, genre mashing, and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s arcade tributes. Yet, Intrusion 2 is none of these things. It is a meeting point between old game design and new, with every other moment punctuated with some of the most thrilling level and boss design to grace the genre.\n\nAs improbable as it may sound, this game made by one guy not only stands up to the classics, it is every bit as good as Gunstar Heroes and Contra.\n\n\n\n\nIntrusion 2 (PC, Mac)\nPublisher: VAP Games\nDeveloper: VAP Games\nReleased: June 20, 2012 (PC), TBA (Mac)\nMSRP: $10\n\nIntrusion 2 is the sequel to a 2008 Flash game. Its sole developer, Aleksey Abramenko, worked on the game for three years, spending upwards of five months on the final boss alone. The effort shows. What doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t show is that this is a solo effort with only music being handled by someone else. The graphics, design, and presentation are great, if not better than much of what you'll find on Xbox Live Arcade.\n\nThere is a certain control scheme that I love but has, for whatever reason, been unpopular throughout the years. Abuse had it. The Showdown Effect will have it.  Intrusion 2 has it and the game makes a perfect case for why fluid, non-restrictive mouse/thumbstick-controlled aiming is so much better. Instead of shooting diagonally, awkwardly trying to position yourself in the right area to hit the enemy, you can jump up and accurately aim. It gives the player so much more freedom in action and helps make Intrusion 2 a fluid and fun shooter from beginning to end.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd8e211fa29b6cac8be5c6c466b297f33eff3e02","amp;dn":"Installintrusion2.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd8e211fa29b6cac8be5c6c466b297f33eff3e02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,142,33,31,162,155,108,172,139,229,198,196,102,178,151,243,62,255,62,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
