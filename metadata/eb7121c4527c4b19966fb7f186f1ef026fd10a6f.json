When we forgive we are in fact restoring our power.\n\nThe last thing you want to do is to think about why forgive somebody that has really hurt you?\n\nIf you do stop and think about the negative energy you are consuming and putting out when you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forgive.\n\nYes just stop and think about that for a minute. The negative energy coming from your hatred is sending you into a negative spiral.\n\nWhy forgive, because if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you are only hurting yourself and giving up your power.\n\nBitterness sets in and this where the law of attraction comes back to bite you! Once you emit bitterness and negativity guess what you get back in return.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly right you get consumed by negativity and hatred.\n\nThis generates a slippery slope for yourself. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to take responsibility for anything. Instead you set out to blame everybody else.\n\nI am talking from first hand experience here.\n\nAfter ten years of marriage and two children, going through a bitter separation is not a pleasant experience.\n\nWhy forgive, because otherwise you dig yourself so deeply into a rat hole and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost impossible to come out.\n\nYour life becomes full of fear and negativity, not to mention bitterness. Who wants to live like that?\n\nYes even in a bitter and hurtful separation you can find it in your heart to forgive. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not easy!\n\nBut when the realisation  hits you that if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forgive you get stuck in a time warp of hatred.\n\nThis makes you reach out and look for explanations. This eventually leads you to realising that it takes two to tango.\n\nIn separation and many situations there are now winners.\n\nSo the best thing you can do is to restore your power and that is why forgive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb7121c4527c4b19966fb7f186f1ef026fd10a6f","amp;dn":"Why+Forgive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb7121c4527c4b19966fb7f186f1ef026fd10a6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,113,33,196,82,124,75,25,150,111,183,241,134,241,239,2,111,209,10,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
