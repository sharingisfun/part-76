Further modulation is possible using the post-processing effects; an all-pass interpolator chorus and delay unit provide a fuller sound and an over-sampled analogue prototype paragraphic equaliser is provided with dual LFOs. These features make for a livelier, more creative sound than typically associated with some convolution reverbs.\n\nIn addition to loading impulse responses from audio files Reverberate is able to generate supplementary independent early reflections and tails for additional control over a roomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sonic characteristics.\n\nDual true-stereo convolution reverb\nZero latency (or select up to 8192 samples latency)\nEarly reflections and tails modules\nTrue stereo simulation for stereo IRs\n168 Presets (including 104 true-stereo files)\nDouble oversampled EQ with modulation per IR\nLinear-interpolation choruses for IR1, IR2 and post effects\nStereo delays with modulation for IR2, IR2 and post effects\nPost EQ with LFO modulation\nModulation via MIDI-CC\nStereo widener with anti-phase reduction\nADSHR envelopes with shape control\nLow CPU downsampling mode option\nPresence filter for adding synthetic high frequency content to dark IRs\nImpulse response chaining\nIntegrated preset and sample browsers\nDrag and drop IRs from OS file browsers\nWav, WIR, SDIR, Aiff and Flac file support\n64-bit VST and AU on Mac and PC\n\n\nPresets and Impulse Responses\n\nReverberate is supplied with a number of presets and impulse responses in order to provide an overview of the plug-in's capabilities, but we strongly encourage you to seek additional impulse responses and experiment with Reverberate's modulation capabilities. Whilst there are many outstanding commercial DVD IR libraries there are some excellent, well respected packages available online such as those at 1313 (rhythminmind.net), Samplicity, Practical Sampling, OpenAIR (UK-based sampled IRs), Echo Chamber and more links at KVR.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nWindows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7\nPC VST/RTAS 32-bit\nPC VST 64-bit t\n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Uninstall previous versions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Next open the .rar file by double clicking it. If you can't open it you need to get an archiver which supports rar files such as Winrar and extract.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Install the setup...\n\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it! Done.\n\n\n\n3Nj0Y!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e81920ca997333e7ba5474ade8d9e8649da75b10","amp;dn":"LiquidSonics+Reverberate+v1.776+-+R2R+%5Bdeepstatus%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e81920ca997333e7ba5474ade8d9e8649da75b10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,25,32,202,153,115,51,231,186,84,116,173,232,217,232,100,157,167,91,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
