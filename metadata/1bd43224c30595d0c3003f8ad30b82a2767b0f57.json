Their debut single &quot;Pick It Up&quot;, immediately became an underground hit (over 5,000 copies, which was a lot those days) and led them to the final of the Rock Rally edition 1980. In Wit-Lof from Belgium, the song was described as being &quot;ska at the speed of sound&quot;. The Offspring, a reknowned American punk band in the nineties, would later incorporate a lot of ideas from &quot;Pick It Up&quot; into their song &quot;Don't Pick It Up&quot; on the CD &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot;, but it didn't come to a lawsuit.\n \nAfter this initial success, they performed a lot of live gigs, or as it is narrated in &quot;Wit-lof From Belgium&quot;, &quot;Organized chaos&quot;. As their cynical frontman Geert Vanroelen said, &quot;Our songs and visual acts are comments on aspects of living in a society we gladly fail to understand&quot;.\n\nAfter a second single &quot;Do The Standing Still&quot; (again with cover art by HergÃƒÂ©-adept Ever Meulen) and a complete album, the disorganization of the group took its toll and they disbanded in 1983.\n\nIn 1993, the group had a reunion (although the lineup had changed since a decade earlier: Michel Decoster (of de Mens) now was on bass). Together, they recorded a full cd called &quot;Radio Debris&quot;. From the record two singles were taken : &quot;Rock'n Roll&quot; and &quot;Fire Brigade&quot; (although I think both songs were bad choices : the best track on the album is the much happier sounding track &quot;Diane&quot;).\n\nA1 Romantic 3:15\t\nA2 The Laura's &amp; The Carols 3:26\t\nA3 Sex &amp; Violence 2:57\t\nA4 Good Enough 2:31\t\nA5 Do The Standing Still 3:02\t\nB1 Hey Ronny 3:00\t\nB2 I Hate Children 3:09\t\nB3 Brussels Is Love 3:25\t\nB4 Light Of My Life 3:02\t\nB5 Tension 3:13\n\nAcoustic Guitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Luk Vandebon\nBass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Karel Theys\nBrass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Marcel Pieters\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Zen (9)\nEngineer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chris Ramon*\nGuitar, Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kloot Per W\nGuitar, Vocals, Piano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dirk Debraekeleer\nProducer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dirk Debraekeleer\nVocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Geert Vanroelen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd43224c30595d0c3003f8ad30b82a2767b0f57","amp;dn":"The+Employees+-+The+Employees+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd43224c30595d0c3003f8ad30b82a2767b0f57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,212,50,36,195,5,149,208,195,0,63,138,211,11,130,162,118,123,15,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
