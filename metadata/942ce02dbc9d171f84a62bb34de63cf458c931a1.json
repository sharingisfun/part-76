How We Invented the World looks at the four inventions that have had the most influence on the way we live now: mobile phones, skyscrapers, cars and aeroplanes. Each of these was not a thing in itself, created from nothing; but a series of connections, separate discoveries that came together to form the final product. Take the car: Henry Ford's adoption of the assembly line; Dunlop's invention of the pneumatic tyre and William Burton's extraction of gasoline from oil. We examine these connections and the people who made them possible.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Aeroplanes \nThe aeroplane - it's made our dream of flight a reality, but the moments of genius and invention it took to invent it involved not just birds as inspiration, but bikes, a trip to the Moon and back, a pair of frozen eyeballs and two nervous breakdowns.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9599/howweinventedtheworldscs.jpg http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/8208/howweinventedtheworldsc.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2118 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 44mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.discoveryuk.com/web/how-we-invented-the-world/about/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:942ce02dbc9d171f84a62bb34de63cf458c931a1","amp;dn":"Discovery.Ch.How.We.Invented.the.World.3of4.Aeroplanes.PDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"942ce02dbc9d171f84a62bb34de63cf458c931a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,44,224,45,188,157,23,31,132,166,43,179,77,230,60,244,88,201,49,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
