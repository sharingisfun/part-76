The whole Ultimate universe basically reset at this point. All the series went back to issue 1 and started fresh. Great place to jump on and try out Ultimate Comics. This is up to date as of 11/29/12. It has all of Spider-Man, X-Men, and Ultimates so far (including the one shots), the four issue Hawkeye mini-series, and the first two Iron Man issues (I think Iron Man is also a four issue mini, but i'm not totally sure). It's been almost two years, so I figured a complete torrent was about due. It was quite a pain in the butt to track a few of these issues down. I'm not the scanner, just a fan and organizer. If people like this, i'll do an update every now and then. Reading order doesn't much matter, as long as you read the Hawkeye mini before you start the Ultimates. ENJOY, I KNOW I DO!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13fa6bd656c8c8b8f35e2548b003cc7c7b8f675a","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Comics+-+Current+and+up+to+date+as+of+11%2F29%2F12.+Everyth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13fa6bd656c8c8b8f35e2548b003cc7c7b8f675a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,250,107,214,86,200,200,184,243,94,37,72,176,3,204,124,123,143,103,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
