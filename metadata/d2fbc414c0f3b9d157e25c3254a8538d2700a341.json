Every Time\n\nCharge is David FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourth solo studio album. Since leaving Easyworld in 2004, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remained defiantly under the mainstream radar, causing a stir with his debut single State Of The Union and its homemade video of a solo performance of the song in his home basement and having his potential breakthrough second album Songs For The Road lost commercially as label Independiente struggled to pay the bills. Accepting his lot, he went back to self-funding, self-promoting for this third album Let The Hard Times Roll and a series of EPs over the past couple of years, continuing to play live and astound his dedicated fanbase.\n\nThe album reflects those struggles heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faced as an artist, documenting a disastrous solo tour of the southern US on Pour A Little Poison, describing himself as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“whiny little English boy singing the bluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“staring at the walls of the Motel 6Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ over a mouth organ led stomp that you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but tap your feet too. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also Philadelphia Boy about the way a crowd in Philadelphia took him to their hearts when he almost broke down on stage during another tour and his subsequent love for the city.\n\nMost potent is however album closer Every Time, six minutes of musing over missed opportunities, getting shafted by the business and waking up to the realization heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s making music that he loves and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important to him. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career summed up in one massive explosion of self-exploration. One criticism occasionally and unfairly thrown at David is that he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t transfer the power and passion of his live shows to record - there can be no such accusations here.\n\nUnlike FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous albums, there are huge variations in pace and mood as the album progresses. The Ballad Of Miss Lily is a balls-out stomp about a man falling in love with one of those girls who just want a guy for his money and Let It Burn has a storming funk beat right through the middle of it with guitar licks dropping in and out in the chorus. And sandwiched between the two is IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t It Strange, one of those tender tear-jerking ballads that Ford produces with impressive regularity. Moving On is another of those, talking of Ã¢â‚¬Å“a mind to let all fortuneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chips fall where they mayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Not To Love is a simple love song played out on piano with the simple chorus refrain Ã¢â‚¬Å“if you asked me why do I love her, then tell me whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not to loveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s followed by the highlight of the album Perfect Soul, another love song but from the angle of a man pleading his case to a woman - Ã¢â‚¬Å“if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re craving romance, then IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll show up bearing flowersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but with the proviso Ã¢â‚¬Å“donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go pinning all your hopes on me, I can make you a pretty promise, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no guaranteeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got some beautiful brass scattered over the chorus and some unusual key changes, but it all fits together perfectly.\n\nCharge may just be FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best album to date. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fit as seamlessly together as the previous ones, but whilst that might be seen as an issue, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually its strength. Ford has never been an artist to play by the traditional rules and with this album heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not bound by any pressure to sell tens of thousands of copies so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s free of any outside constraints or expectations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2fbc414c0f3b9d157e25c3254a8538d2700a341","amp;dn":"David+Ford+-+Charge+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2fbc414c0f3b9d157e25c3254a8538d2700a341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,251,196,20,192,243,185,209,87,226,92,50,84,168,83,141,39,0,163,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
