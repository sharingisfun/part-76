The documentaries \n\nand materials have merely be resorted into chronological order to make \n\nthem more accessable. \n\nThe folders are named by date of the event or period, followed by a \n\ntitle which more or less suggests the content. Some folders may cover \n\na period across several centuries, while others may cover a single \n\nevent. Historic figures before the twentieth century are generally \n\nlisted under their date of birth, then death, while political figures \n\nof the last century or so, are listed by the dates during which they \n\nwere in power. Some individuals appear by their date of death where \n\nthis is more appropriate. The entire collection covers from 1400 BC to \n\nthe present. Every major event in world history is represented in its \n\nindividual folder. Some folders may only have a single documentary, \n\nwhile others may have a great number of video files and books.\n\nIt is suggested that you might use a torrent client like utorrent \n\nwhich allows the user to select the files they wish to download, as \n\nsome folders may have far to much material to be practicable as a \n\nsingle download.\n\nTo visit the entire index, go to:\n\nthepiratebay.se/user/TeachersResources/\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94e9d167ac65d4f15ef7b321d336350b96c4ef77","amp;dn":"1519-+1521+Spanish+Invasion+of+Mexico","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94e9d167ac65d4f15ef7b321d336350b96c4ef77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,233,209,103,172,101,212,241,94,247,179,33,211,54,53,11,150,196,239,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
