Bang Kwang maximum security prison on the outskirts of Bangkok allowed the BBC for the first time to enter the prison and film about the prison that the Thais call the &quot;Big Tiger&quot;, as it will eat you up, but the western world refers to it as &quot;The Bangkok Hilton&quot;, where many inmates are literally serving a 50 - 99 year life sentence! \n\nMichael Connell is only 19; thin and frail a supermarket worker from Manchester, his lawyers say he has a mental age of some one several years younger, but he talks clearly of the day to day life in jail. The only foreigner in a dorm of 1000, he survives by teaching his fellow inmates English. He got 99 years for smuggling 3000 Ecstasy pills into the country where few can afford them; he won't explain why. Connell is nervous as the new boy; his last words to camera are &quot;even David Beckham couldn't get me out of here...&quot;. Lifer Andrew Hawkes is a complete mystery - a long-term veteran prisoner who has somehow fallen through the cracks. Hawkes speaks freely of his foolish decision to smuggle heroin after an offer from a stranger in an Amsterdam bar. Hawkes gives us a tour - pointing out the death row prisoners shuffling past. Each group forms their own society in the jail\n\nEnjoy!!\n\ncheublawm\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d16ffdcc4891b60e33749104d4919082bc5f576d","amp;dn":"REAL+BANGKOK+HILTON+%5B2004%5D+XVID+by+cheublawm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d16ffdcc4891b60e33749104d4919082bc5f576d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,111,253,204,72,145,182,14,51,116,145,4,212,145,144,130,188,95,87,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
