He is rescued by Princess Diana and learns of the war against the Nazis. The Amazons decide to send one of their own to help fight in this crisis. Although forbidden to participate in the selection process, Diana joins secretly and wins the right and responsibility to go. Taking the still unconscious Major to safety, she joins him as Yeoman Diana Prince. Furthermore, when the forces of evil threaten the nation, Diana would spin to transform into Wonder Wonder, armed with a magic belt giving her tremendous strength, bracelets that can stop any bullet, a tiara that can be thrown as a returning weapon and a unbreakable magic lasso that can force anyone to tell the truth. After WW II, she returned to the Island, only to encounter Steve Trevor Jr., agent for IADC, thirty years later. Seeing the amazing coincidence as a sign, she returns to the Man world once more to resume her role as the greatest of the female superheroes.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4574170e43f765b1884ff1e38fa4fe10852e3847","amp;dn":"Wonder+Woman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4574170e43f765b1884ff1e38fa4fe10852e3847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,116,23,14,67,247,101,177,136,79,241,227,143,164,254,16,133,46,56,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
