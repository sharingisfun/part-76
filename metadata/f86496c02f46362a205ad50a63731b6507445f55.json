This guy is next in the Project Superpowers collection I am compiling:\n\nAfter his parents were killed in an airplane accident, Allen Turner was raised by his scientist uncle to become &quot;outstanding in mind and body.&quot; A brilliant scientist, he had no super powers but did have a boomerang-shaped airplane dubbed The Wing\n\nthat flew by the power of Earth's magnetic poles. He worked out of a hidden hangar/laboratory dubbed The Skydrome. With this and the money he inherited from his late uncle's will, he fought crime. Skyman carried two pistols; an Atomatic and a Stasimatic. He was in a steady relationship with Fawn Carroll, who loved both Allen and Skyman.\n\n\nGolden Age Appearances \n    Big Shot Comics #1-101\n    Skyman #1-4\n    Sparky Watts #1 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f86496c02f46362a205ad50a63731b6507445f55","amp;dn":"Skyman+Collection+1940+Columbia+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f86496c02f46362a205ad50a63731b6507445f55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,100,150,192,47,70,54,42,32,90,213,10,99,115,27,101,7,68,95,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
