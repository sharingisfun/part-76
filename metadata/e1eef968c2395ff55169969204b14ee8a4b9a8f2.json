A particularly intractable coating of rust on an item spurs Rick to send Tyler and Ron to investigate a type of sandblasting called sodablasting, which uses sodium bicarbonate.[5] A box in the alley near the shop's showroom is discovered to be infested with bees, which leads to a thankless task for Brettly, who dons a makeshift hazard suit held together with duct tape. \n\n3\t3\t&quot;Lights Out&quot;\tNone\tNovember 1, 2010\nThe shop restores one of the lamp posts on magician Lance Burton's property which was shattered into countless pieces by a windstorm. Though the lamps are modern re-creations of 1890s-style street lamps, they were custom made for the Monte Carlo Hotel from which Burton acquired them and require Ron, Kowboy, Tyler, and Brettly to gather all the debris from Burton's desert hillside property in order for it to be repaired. The shop also restores a 1930s Eco Model 15 tire air meter brought in by Tyler's math teacher, which belonged to his grandfather. Rick assigns Tyler the lead responsibility on the air meter, including giving the estimate, in order to encourage his education in the business, but Tyler's low estimate results in his having to finish the project by himself. \n\n4\t4\t&quot;Buttered Up&quot;\tNone\tNovember 1, 2010\nThe shop restores a large scale, 1956 Popsicle toy train locomotive, which includes creating two back cars from scratch to go with it, and an antique 1948 Manleymachine, purchased by an elderly man from a Tennessee movie theater he used to frequent as a child before it recently closed permanently. \n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_Restoration_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_Restoration_episodes&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1eef968c2395ff55169969204b14ee8a4b9a8f2","amp;dn":"American+Restoration+Season+1+Complete+2010+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1eef968c2395ff55169969204b14ee8a4b9a8f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,238,249,104,194,57,95,245,81,105,150,146,4,177,78,232,164,185,168,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
