How about gunning?  What if special abilities are\nthrown into the mix?  Upgradable weapons?  Lets say therere dozens of\non-screen enemies to unleash this firepower on, and as your reward for\ndispatching them you get experience and gold to collect that can be used for\ncharacter customization and new equipment--all the while playing alongside\nfriends in 4-player cooperative play!  If you like the sound of all this,\nthen youll love God Mode.\n\nRetro shooter action and RPG elements are combined in this new downloadable\nthird-person shooter. God Mode combines non-linear gameplay, fast and frantic\nshooting, hordes of on-screen enemies, a fully functional online coop mode,\nand features visuals and gameplay that rival that of a full-priced boxed\ntitle. Matches rarely--if ever--play out the same, as dozens of in-game\nmodifiers can significantly alter the gameplay on the fly. Characters are\nfully customizable, both in appearance and equipment, which continually\nevolve. Gold and experience are constantly accrued and used to unlock new and\nsatisfying weaponry and unique powerful abilities, both of which can be\nfurther upgraded.\n\nFeatures\n* Cooperative multiplayer for up to 4 players (with special PvP locations)\n* Extensive character customization\n\n\n1.
