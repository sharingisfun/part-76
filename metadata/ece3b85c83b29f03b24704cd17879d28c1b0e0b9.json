Their best remembered track was &quot;Always Remember to Respect and Honour Your Mother Part One&quot; (Go! Beat Records/Polydor Records) in 2001, which reached #31 on the UK Singles Chart.[1] The song featured a 12-year old schoolboy vocal from Alan Young.[1]\n\nIn July 2009, Bates announced on MySpace that the second part of the project would be named All Thieves, and feature vocals from Kristian Leontiou and Bailey Tzuke. The CD which is to be called 'We Are All Thieves' is ready for release. All Thieves' tracks &quot;Turn And Turn Again&quot; and &quot;We Will Be Dust&quot; were featured in Grey's Anatomy in 2009.\n\n\nSafe From Harm the second album from Dusted, was released in 2005. It was a reworking of the outfit's 2001 debut, and was accompanied by an 80-page, illustrated hardcover book with the same name.\n\n\n&quot;When We Were Young&quot; Track Listing\n\n\n01 - Childhood 5:31\n02 - Time Takes Time 5:41\n03 - Want U 6:50\n04 - Hurt U 1:45\n05 - If You Go Down to the Woods 3:17\n06 - Always Remember to Respect Your Mother, Pt. 1 3:49\n07 - The Biggest Fool in the World 6:47\n08 - Oh, How Sweet 5:02\n09 - Always Remember to Respect Your Mother, Pt. 24:01\n10 - Winter 4:33\n11 - The Oscar Song 2:11\n12 - Under the Sun 5:36\n13 - If I Had a Child 3:31\n14 - Always Remember to Respect and Honour Your Mother&quot; (remix) 6:35\n\n\n&quot;Safe From Harm&quot; Track Listing\n\n\n01 - In the Beginning 4:06\n02 - Time Takes Time (Ft.
