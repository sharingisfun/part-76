It is the home of Disneyland, the second most popular amusement park in the world.\n\nFrom Anaheim Disney has for decades been selling an image of fantasy to millions of visitors every year. &quot;To me it just looked like our happiest place on earth had just turned into Afghanistan.&quot;\n- Amber Stephens, a local journalist\n\nBut over the summer, anger that had been growing in communities living in the shadows of this multi-billion dollar tourist industry began spiralling out of control.\n\nIn July 2012, two young Latino men were shot and killed by Anaheim police. What followed was some of the worst civil unrest this city has ever seen. Protests against police brutality were met with riot-clad gear police and rubber bullets, further fuelling violence and bringing national attention to the home of Disneyland.\n\nThe images shocked the country but left unanswered questions: Why did it happen? Will it happen elsewhwere in the US? And are there two Anaheims? Fault Lines examines the underlying causes of the recent unrest in Anaheim.\n\nFlv: http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/faultlines/2012/12/20121211112848544968.htm\n\nshunster\nRepost anywhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05149d6e015fa704c2f7260fafa6af6fd27e0c80","amp;dn":"Anaheim%3A+A+Tale+of+Two+Cities++2012++12++12+++AJE++Fault+Lines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05149d6e015fa704c2f7260fafa6af6fd27e0c80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,20,157,110,1,95,167,4,194,247,38,15,175,166,175,111,210,126,12,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
