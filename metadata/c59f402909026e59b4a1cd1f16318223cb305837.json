Introduced in 1964, the Class 421 4CIG (4-car Corridor Brighton stock) ran as a 4-car train comprising a driving trailer, motor coach, unpowered trailer coach and finally a driving trailer. It is a classic example of the slam door EMUs which were once such a familiar sight across the rail networks of southern England. Extensive 3rd-rail electrification of the Southern Region led to the widespread adoption of these 90mph EMUs, and the 4CIG (British Rail Class 421) was initially introduced on the London-Brighton Line where its multiple doors enabled rapid turnaround of passengers at the many regular station stops . The 4CIG units received a facelift in the late 1980s, and continued in mainline passenger service into the 21st Century!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: the London to Brighton Expansion Pack (available separately) is required to play the scenarios included with this add-on.\n\nIncludes\nClass 421 4CIG electric multiple unit in Southern livery\n\n2 free roams and 2 scenarios for the London to Brighton Expansion Pack\n\nGatwick to Brighton\nCapital Coast Express\nHome from the Seaside","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59f402909026e59b4a1cd1f16318223cb305837","amp;dn":"Train+Simulator+2013+-+4CIG+Southern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59f402909026e59b4a1cd1f16318223cb305837","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,159,64,41,9,2,110,89,180,161,205,31,22,49,130,35,203,48,88,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
