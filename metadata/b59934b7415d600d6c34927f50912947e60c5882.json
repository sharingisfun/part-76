Through the use of technology SMART, Hard Drive Inspector allows you to predict the possible failure of the HDD before it happens, that allows you to create backups of important information and save it. The program has flexible settings, allowing the utility to completely customize to fit their needs.\n\nThe value of data stored on computer hard drive often exceeds the cost of the computer itself. When a drive fails (which happens quite often), the information stored on it, partially or completely lost. Using the technology of SMART, Hard Drive Inspector can monitor the current state of various life-critical parameters describing the reliability and performance of the disk. Analyzes this data and warns the user if the parameters indicate a critical reduction of disk reliability. This is, in many cases to prevent loss of information.\n\nHard Drive Inspector is an easy-to-use program that monitors computer disks' health to prevent crashes and expensive hard disk recovery. The value of information stored on an average computer hard drive often exceeds the value of the computer itself. But a hard drive is one of the most unreliable internal computer devices. When it crashes (which happens quite frequently), the stored information will be lost fully or partially. Subsequent hard drive recovery is either not possible at all, or constitutes a very sophisticated and expensive procedure that can be performed only by specialists.\n\nModern hard drives support S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) that was specially developed to detect upcoming disk failures. Using this technology Hard Drive Inspector can monitor the current state of various life-critical parameters describing a disk's reliability and performance. Hard Drive Inspector analyzes this data and warns the user if the parameters indicate a critical reduction of disk reliability. Timely alerts make it possible to copy the data and replace an unreliable disk, thus preventing information loss and costly hard drive data recovery.\n\nMain Features:\n\n- SMART technology makes it possible to predict the possible failure of the HDD\n- Create backups of important information\n- Flexible configuration allows a completely customized utility for their needs.\n- User friendly multilingual interface\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows 2000/XP/2003 Server/Vista/Windows 7 \n\nHomepage: http://www.altrixsoft.com\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Copy content from crack folder and paste into default installation directory.\n- Done, Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b59934b7415d600d6c34927f50912947e60c5882","amp;dn":"Hard+Drive+Inspector+v4.1.145+Pro+and+for+Notebooks+Incl+Crack+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b59934b7415d600d6c34927f50912947e60c5882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,153,52,183,65,93,96,13,108,52,146,127,80,145,41,71,230,12,88,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
