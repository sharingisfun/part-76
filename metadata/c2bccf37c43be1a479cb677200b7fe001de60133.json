The new firmware was dumped from a less restricted Alltel phone.\n\nIf you still receive service on this phone, I can't guarantee that you will be able to keep using the service.  Keep your SIM card in just in case.  There is also a possibility of bricking your phone, but it didn't happen to me after many failed attempts.  Back up anything important for this reason.\n\nIncludes:\n\nPK2 driver\nRSD Lite\nK1m firmware\ninstructions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2bccf37c43be1a479cb677200b7fe001de60133","amp;dn":"KRZR+K1m+reflash+for+Verizon.7Z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2bccf37c43be1a479cb677200b7fe001de60133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,188,207,55,196,59,225,164,121,203,103,114,0,183,254,0,29,230,1,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
