There are eleven dance moves, each one a different combination of four buttons, two of which are always the &quot;X&quot; button. The game also contains a dozen interviews along with other entertaining moments, such as Geri Halliwell pinching Prince Charles' bottom, and the girls wreaking havoc on a Japanese talk-show.\nIn the game, players have to prepare the Spice Girls for a live television concert by doing such things as teaching them the dance steps they must do for the performance, choosing the song they will perform, and the sequence in which the song's lyrics will be sung. When it's time for the show to happen, the player gets to be a camera-person, deciding which camera shots will go and the angle from which the girls will be seen. The player gets to watch the girls &quot;sing&quot; and dance as the player has directed them to, with the camera shots selected by the player. The player is instructed by a disco king on what to do. The Spice Girls lent their voices to their characters in the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72f19562d9e56c7a711d876c9264719860efedbe","amp;dn":"Spice+World+%28video+game%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72f19562d9e56c7a711d876c9264719860efedbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,241,149,98,217,229,108,122,113,29,135,108,146,100,113,152,96,239,237,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
