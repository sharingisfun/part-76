When most bands play\nit safe, we try to go our own way and incorporate\nall kinds of twists and turns into our music.\nWe think this is our best sounding release and\nour most interesting work to date. This being our\nsecond release with this line up, we feel that we\nhave really hit our stride and everyone know\nwhat to do to make the sweet music we call\nDeadly Doom.\nLyrically both songs are linked and therefore\nbeing Part one and two. Part one deals with an\nawakening, to see things for what they are,  what\nimpact your actions has on  your surroundings\nand the once around you.\nPart two is about the liberation from all that. A\nclosure if you like.\nWe feel certain that these two songs will leave\nyou longing for more of our Epic Doom/Death\nMetal.\n\nwww.thegardnerz.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c85dd4c468f6f6336e5b13848fc51f9829f68f6","amp;dn":"The+Gardnerz+-+Exiting+Reality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c85dd4c468f6f6336e5b13848fc51f9829f68f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,133,221,76,70,143,111,99,54,229,177,56,72,252,81,249,130,159,104,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
