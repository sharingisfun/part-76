His piano concerto - &quot;within the mirror of time&quot; - is one of his most intriguing and arresting works. Recorded by pianist Bela Siki, for whom it was written, and the Seattle Symphony, the LP of the work was released by Columbia Recoreds on its Odyssey label, in 1976 but has never been released on CD to my knowledge. This is a digital version of the LP. This is the concerto only - I have transcribed the Schuman sympony that was the LP's &quot;B&quot; side.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c13116be6b00bb382dd67bc5b906b9fe6233b5","amp;dn":"Contcerto%3A+%26quot%3Bwithin+the+mirror+of+time%26quot%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c13116be6b00bb382dd67bc5b906b9fe6233b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,193,49,22,190,107,0,187,56,45,214,123,197,185,6,185,254,98,51,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
