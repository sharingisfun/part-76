The boy born from a peach; the princess from the moon who is discovered inside a bamboo; the old man who can make a dead cherry tree blossom, etc. These short stories that teach kids to see both the dark and bright sides of life have passed traditional moral values from generation to generation.\n\n Each half-hour episode of FOLKTALES FROM JAPAN consists of three self-contained stories, well-known and unknown, with a special focus on heartwarming stories that originate from Tohoku, the northern region heavily touched by the earthquake of 2011. May this program help cheer up earthquake victims and cast a light of hope for them.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19e555e8d256dac5276622bab9d1d49ba7d400d5","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Folktales+from+Japan+-+33+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19e555e8d256dac5276622bab9d1d49ba7d400d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,229,85,232,210,86,218,197,39,102,34,186,185,209,212,155,167,212,0,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
