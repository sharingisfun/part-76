He chases the man who has it and they have a brawl on top of a train. Eve, an agent sent to assist Bond has them in her cross hairs but hesitates to take the shot because she might hit Bond but M orders her to take it. She does, and hits Bond who falls into the river and is believed to be dead. A few months later, the British government is upset with MI6 for losing the list; specifically with M. She is told that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be allowed to retire but she refuses to leave till the matter is resolved. So she returns to HQ to work on it but as she arrives, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an explosion. In the meantime, Bond, who is not dead, has been laying low. When he learns of what happened, he returns. And M tasks him with finding the one who has the information. He eventually learns that the man who has it, is someone from MÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past and who has it in for her.\n\nSeed and Share.\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0270347109a5ff4e573ffb158c55aba171c8a70d","amp;dn":"Skyfall+2012+TS+ps157--550MB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0270347109a5ff4e573ffb158c55aba171c8a70d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,112,52,113,9,165,255,78,87,63,251,21,140,85,171,161,113,200,167,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
