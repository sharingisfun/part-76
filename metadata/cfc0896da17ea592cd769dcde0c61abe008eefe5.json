The big Blinddog bus has carried on tour such notables as Zora Young, Miss Blues, Aynsley Lister, and HollandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Coen Wolters.

(Off. Website)\n\nCarl Gustafson is the leader and singer for Blinddog SmokinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which has released eight CDs and forty-one original songs since 1993. The eight-piece band has performed coast to coast and internationally since 1992. They appeared three times on the main stage at the King Biscuit Blues Festival and were on the cover of the now defunct King Biscuit Time Magazine with Bobby Rush. Carl is now the festival promoter for the Snowy Range Music Festival in Wyoming, his home State.\nThe nine songs: Carl draws from his extensive travels during his decades-long musical career. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I bring moments to life for everybody to examine and learn from, and hopefully, be entertained by,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. For example, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you give yourself to the lyrics of Miss PeggyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s After-hours Pic-a-Rib CafÃƒÂ©, which I wrote about a special lady, a unique place, and a poignant time in my life, you can actually go there with me and share my fondness of that memory. To me, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about, this music businessÃ¢â‚¬â€not money, not fame, not prestige, just eloquent enlightenments.&quot;\nAcross the songs, we meet more real people: a prostitute who told the band to make their music sound Ã¢â‚¬Å“like money,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a preacher disillusioned by religion, Bobby Rush joining the singing about his legendary bus, a man who loves two women in an painful situation, and the ghost of Sonny Boy Williamson II telling about coming home to Helena to die. The songs are performed by a whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who of instrumentalists and background vocalists, all Blues stars from Chicago, Mississippi, California, and Texas, including special guests Billy Branch, Sherman Robertson, Carl Weathersby, and Bobby Rush.
