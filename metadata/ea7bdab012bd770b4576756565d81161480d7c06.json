So now I have them all nice and neat in one folder for your enjoyment. I didn't make these video files, so be warned, they're not spectacular quality and some have some weird three second loop in some parts. But all in all they look fine on a computer. Think VCR quality if the vcr tape sat in the sun for a while. lol.
