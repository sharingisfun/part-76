His true name unrevealed, the protagonist was the surviving member of a group of corporate outcasts who called themselves the Death Hawks. When the group was betrayed by one of their own, Death Hawk escaped in his 50-year-old spaceship the Peregrine. With the aid of his bio-engineered sidekick, Cyke, Death Hawk traveled the spaceways eluding arrest warrants and creditors, his eye always out for ways to keep his salvage business going - often when legality was questionable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9a10649811ff9d0a79fa2965bf62e7a1917335","amp;dn":"Death+Hawk+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc9a10649811ff9d0a79fa2965bf62e7a1917335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,154,16,100,152,17,255,157,10,121,250,41,101,191,98,231,161,145,115,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
