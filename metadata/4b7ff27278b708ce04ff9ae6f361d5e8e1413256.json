If they can't send it to you, they will send it back where it came from. And \n\nthere will be postage due - far more than the third class bulk rate it cost to mail it \n\nto you. They'll have to pay first class rates to get it back. They won't know what \n\nthey're getting back until AFTER they pay the postage (the post office is sneaky that \n\nway).\n\nIf millions do this, then they WILL stop. It'll cost them too much to continue.\n\n========== Related action - France:\n\nEver hear of &quot;The Denver Boot&quot;? It's that cup thing they attach to the wheel of your \n\ncar so you can't move it until you pay up.\n\nIn France, every good citizen knows that when passing such a device to fill the lock \n\nwith super glue so every time a &quot;boot&quot; is installed, it is destroyed.\n\nAnd that's why France no longer uses &quot;The Denver Boot&quot;.\n\nWe are all just one person.\n\nWe are all billions of people.\n\nAVIGUY\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b7ff27278b708ce04ff9ae6f361d5e8e1413256","amp;dn":"Last.Resort.S01E09.Cinderella.Liberty.HDTV.XVID-AVIGUY.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b7ff27278b708ce04ff9ae6f361d5e8e1413256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,127,242,114,120,183,8,206,4,255,154,230,243,97,213,232,225,65,50,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
