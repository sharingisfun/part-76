Slade scored six number ones in the \n70s, a feat rivalled only by Abba. Formed in Wolverhampton and led by Noddy \nHolder, Slade sold over 50 million records worldwide during a 20-year career \nwhich saw them re-invent themselves as skinhead yobs, then mirror-hatted \nplatform-shoe-pioneering glam gods, before finally re-emerging as hard rock \nheroes. \n\nTheir poorly-spelled, self-written selection of terrace anthems included Cum on \nFeel the Noize, Coz I Luv You, Take Me Bak Ome, Mama Weer All Crazee Now and, \nunforgettably, Merry Xmas Everybody. Apart from Noddy and his bandmates - Dave \nHill, Jim Lea and Don Powell - the cast here also includes Noel Gallagher of \nOasis (who covered Cum On Feel the Noize), Status Quo, Toyah Wilcox, Suzi \nQuatro and Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nAltogether now &quot;Are you hanging up your stocking on the wall..........?&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5e1ff77148749275cf767a4164ef618f7fd4a86","amp;dn":"BBC+It%27s+Slade+1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5e1ff77148749275cf767a4164ef618f7fd4a86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,225,255,119,20,135,73,39,92,247,103,164,22,78,246,24,247,253,74,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
