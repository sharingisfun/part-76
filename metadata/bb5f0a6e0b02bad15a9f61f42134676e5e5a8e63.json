Unfortunately, it can and often does! O&amp;O DiskImage lets you create images of your entire computer or individual partitions while you work. If data loss occurs, your imaged data (files, folders, partitions) can be restored in no time at all ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ even if Windows is unable to start!\n\nImage entire PCs, individual drives or files\n\nThe most reliable way to protect yourself against data loss is if you make regular backups of your data and the operating system and store it on an external storage medium. When backing up your PC, O&amp;O DiskImage saves both personal files as well as drive information and individual settings. This not only protects irreplaceable files, such as family photos, vacation videos and office documents, but you also save yourself in the event of a crash the lengthy set up and reinstall of all the programs and the Windows operating system.\n\nRegular images are a must\n\nTo make sure your backups are always up to date, we recommend that you perform regular backups at short intervals. You can automate this with O&amp;O DiskImage, so that your data is backed up say once a week, for example, automatically and in the background.\n\nQuick and easy restoration\n\nIf you have backed up individual drives, you can easily restore them over the user interface of O&amp;O DiskImage under Windows. To restore an entire PC or the system partition you can run O&amp;O DiskImage without installation directly from the boot media.\n\nMachine independent restoration\n\nThe M.I.R. (Machine Independent Restoration) feature allows you to also restore or duplicate an entire PC or system partition on a computer whose hardware is different from the original machine, for instance, where you have changed hardware components on the target machine, or have bought a brand new PC and want to restore an old image onto it.\n\nRestore files and folders\n\nFor restoring file backups, that only include files and folders, you can use most popular compression tools such as WinZIP ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ entirely independent from the O&amp;O DiskImage program.\n\nTools\n\nNEW: Create a boot CD from the program itself\nNEW: Even simpler and quicker user interface\nHigh-performance compression and encryption of images\nSupport for dynamic and GPT volumes\nExclude certain files and/or file types\nIntegration of data from ISO files\nCheck drives and images for errors\nWorks with Microsoft Virtual PC Disks (VHD)\nAdvanced report management and e-mail notifications\n\nSystem requirements\n\nMinimum requirements of the respective system\nAt least 1 GB RAM recommended\n30 MB free hard disk space\n32/64-bit Support\nWindowsÃ¢â€Â¬Ã‚Â« 8, 7, VistaÃ¢â€Â¬Ã‚Â«, and XP (all Editions)\n\nHomepage: http://www.oo-software.com/en/products/oodiskimage\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n1.
