(Aarti Prabhu) by the same name, the screen adaptation was by Shyam Benegal and Girish Karnad.\nKondura was a very brilliant novel written in Marathi by the prolific Marathi novelist, writer and playwright Mr. Chintamani T. Khanolkar (poetry under pen name Aarti Prabhu), who died before Shyam Benegal made the film. Benegal took the rights from him, and wanted to make it in Marathi. But found that he just couldn't get funding to make a film in Marathi, because the Marathi cinema audience had really shrunk. So he decided to change the old story from the west coast of India to the east coast. When he did that, he was able to do it in Telugu; which he did, and was able to find a Telugu producer quite easily. The film was also made in Hindi which was never released.\nThe film was also shot in a Telugu version, titled Anugraham. The cast in both the films was similar and included Smita Patil, Anant Nag, Amrish Puri, and Satyadev Dubey.\n\nPlot:\nJogamma is the widow of Brahmin Pandit Range Rao, and lives in a coastal village in Southern India along with her two married sons, Narsimha, who is married to Seethamma and has two sons; while Parasuram is married to Ansuya. Narsimha, who not only looks after the estate, but also works as a clerk, often ends up chiding Parsuram to do something proactive. A frustrated Parshuram, not able to bear the taunts of his family anymore decides to run away from home, but has an encounter with a Sage named Kondura, who is believed to be living under the sea for ions. Kondura bestows a boon upon him, asks him not to misuse it, and be a celibate. A disbelieving Parshuram returns home, finds out that Guru is yet another person who was granted the boon of finding water, even in arid areas, and asks him to help dig a well. Guru does help and water is discovered shortly thereafter. Parshuram claims that he can also converse with a Goddess in the local Mandir... \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077818/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077818/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast:\nAnant Nag - Parashuram R.
