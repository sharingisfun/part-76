It came from three separate installation CDs that have been sitting on a shelf collecting dust for years. They are in fairly bad condition, but I was able to successfully copy them to my PC and allow you to install it! I am doing this mostly for preservation, but also for those who are interested! \n\nThe installation procedure is fairly simple. If you came across this looking for on older Linux distro, you probably already know how to install it, but I will walk you through regardless. \n\nIf you'd like to install this on an actual PC, you will need to simply burn the discs to a CD. I recommend using CDBurnerXP (http://cdburnerxp.se/en/home). There are a lot of other free burning programs, so feel free to search &quot;free burner software&quot; in your favorite search engine. When you're done burning these to a disc, simply insert them in the PC's optical drive. Boot from the drive and follow the on-screen instructions. It's fairly simple from there!\n\nIf you're looking to run this inside an already installed OS, I recommend that you use VMWare Player (http://www.vmware.com/products/player/) which is a free virtual machine manager. When you've installed that, simply select the ISOs and install it from there! Everything is well explained in the program itself. \nDual boot is also an option ;)\n\nOther notes: \n-For a successful installation, only disc 1 (install disc) is required. Disc 2 and 3 are all extras, but are provided anyway.\n-VirtualBox should work as well. Other virtual machine programs should also work.\n-If you plan to fully install this on a physical PC, I recommend it be an older machine from the Pentium III era as this version is designed to work around older machines (by today's standards). \n\nHope you enjoy!
