The Magpies have not beaten City in 11 Premier League matches, and the 2-0 win Roberto Mancini's side earned at St James' Park in May - largely thanks to Yaya Toure's superb opening goal - was absolutely crucial in helping the success-starved Blues lift their first league championship title since 1968.\n\nIn the north west, Martin O'Neill takes his Sunderland side to Old Trafford, desperate to prove his credentials. He has been spoken of as a potential eventual successor to Manchester United's legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson, but his early stewardship of the Black Cats has been far from spectacular.\n\nElsewhere, Liverpool host Aston Villa at Anfield as they continue to build under the watchful eye of Brendan Rogers, while Norwich entertain Wigan, Stoke welcome Everton, and QPR contest a west London derby with Fulham.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52ca49153d9e46dc83f6fde565e8cb9389f88687","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+15.12.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52ca49153d9e46dc83f6fde565e8cb9389f88687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,202,73,21,61,158,70,220,131,246,253,229,101,232,203,147,137,248,134,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
