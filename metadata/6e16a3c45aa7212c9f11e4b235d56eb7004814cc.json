Williams plays a Soviet Russian circus musician who defects while on a visit to the United States. The film was released on April 3, 1984.\n\nThe film features the late Soviet comedic actor Saveliy Kramarov, as the apparatchik/KGB officer, in one of his first Western film roles. Ironically, Kramarov was a Soviet Russian comedian who gave up a successful film career in his homeland for religious freedom and bit parts in films in the United States. He made 42 films in the former Soviet Union before he was allowed to leave in the early 1980s. This reality seems to mirror Vladimir's defection to the U.S. in the film.\n\nThe three Russian actors Kramarov, Oleg Rudnik, and Elya Baskin also appear together in the film 2010 as cosmonauts. Kramarov and Rudnik play the two KGB agents always shadowing Vladimir and Baskin plays Vladimir's friend the circus clown. Stand up comedian Yakov Smirnoff also has a minor role in the film.\n\nWilliams learned Russian in a crash course for the film and also learned to play the saxophone.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e16a3c45aa7212c9f11e4b235d56eb7004814cc","amp;dn":"Moscow+on+the+Hudson+%5B1984%5D+Robin+Williams+VOB+Files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e16a3c45aa7212c9f11e4b235d56eb7004814cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,22,163,196,90,167,33,44,159,17,228,178,53,213,110,183,0,72,20,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
