This game is a re-imagination of the existing title. Characters resemble their manga and anime counterparts even more, and fans of the series can live through the earth shaking battles they have seen.\nFight the Hokuto, Nanto and the Special way, but personalize your style as you develop your character. The Legend Mode returns, but it will be expanded to include even more content.\nThe Dream Mode has more scenarios for the recurring cast. Some of these are written specifically for this game to explain the origins of Hokuto Shinken to add to the depth of the series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f534d8cbf19d55bd6f681e2b53813913f61f076","amp;dn":"Shin_Hokuto_Musou_JPN_XBOX360-Caravan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f534d8cbf19d55bd6f681e2b53813913f61f076","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,83,77,140,191,25,213,91,214,246,129,226,181,56,19,145,63,97,240,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
