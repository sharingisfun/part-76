For decades, they have been governed by a strong security paradigm, and the Camp David accords with Israel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ underwritten by billions of dollars in US military aid.\n\n&quot;Only the people of Sinai can defeat terrorism; the central government is not going to defeat terrorism, it's stoking terrorism through its practices.&quot; - Hossam Baghat, Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights\n\nNow they are back in the international spotlight because of an increase in militant attacks, arms smuggling and human trafficking.\n\nWhen Egyptians took to the streets against Hosni MubarakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s police state in January 2011, the Sinai was no exception. But the insurgency here continued long after his ouster, causing worry among some of EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful backers.\n\nThe true test of the evolving Egyptian relationship with the US then may lie in CairoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to control any instability in the peninsula.\n\nFault Lines explores the roots of SinaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ongoing uprising and, as EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new leaders vow to crack down on militancy and smuggling, the dangers of following an old script. How did the Sinai Peninsula become a crucible for geopolitical tensions?\n\nFlv:http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/faultlines/2012/12/2012121874352233407.html\n\nshunster.  repost anywhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cc71a753db78b2f33e0b455955f70ea9e3bbb33","amp;dn":"Battle+for+the+Sinai++2012+11+19++Aljazeera++Fault+Lines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cc71a753db78b2f33e0b455955f70ea9e3bbb33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,199,26,117,61,183,139,47,51,224,180,85,149,95,112,234,158,59,187,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
