First aired and captured in H264 AVCHD at 8,000 kbps from the 1920 x 1080i HD source on 12/06/2012 on the Spike TV HD channel on DirecTv HDTV Digital Satellite then converted to 16:9 widescreen 1280 x 720p resolution Framerate is 59.940 with an average Video Bitrate of 6,000 kbps in a High Quality 2.46 GB 720p H264 AVCHD MP4 release with 48khz 384 kbps AAC 2 channel stereo audio show runtime 1 Hour 26 minutes 20 seconds.\n\nThis is my 162nd official 720p H264 AVCHD-SC-SDH release. Enjoy the show TNA Impact wrestling fans. \n\nMy releases are in MP4 format with AAC 2 channel stereo audio so that they are playable with VLC player as well as Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, Sony Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Samsung Galaxy S III smartphones, iPhone, iPad, and any other devices capable of playing 720p HD MP4 video files. \n\nIf you want this show in MKV format it is easy to convert it from MP4 to MKV using MKVtoolnix 2.2.0 (MKVmerge 2.2.0) which you can download from here: http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/win32/mkvtoolnix-2.2.0-setup.exe\n\nHere's how to do it: Download and install MKVMerge (Use link above). It is a free program that allows you to take video and audio files and convert them into MKV files on the fly, making it a very quick conversion.\n\nOpen MKVMerge on your computer, and you will be greeted by its home menu. Click the &quot;Add&quot; button that is near the top of the program, and a new window will appear giving you access to your computer's files. Locate your MP4 video and select it. Press &quot;Open,&quot; and it will load into MKVMerge.\n\nPress the &quot;Browse&quot; button at the bottom of the program, and a window will appear. Locate a place on your computer to save the new MKV file after it is created. Once you have found a place, click &quot;Save&quot; to save the location. Click the &quot;Start Muxing&quot; button at the bottom of the program and your MKV file will be created. Depending on the size of the file, it could take a few minutes. Once it is finished locate the MKV file after the program congratulates you on the conversion and play it as you would any other video file.\n\n\nTo ensure that you can get proper playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nOnce installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:\n\nMedia Player Classic, Power DVD, or Windows Media Player. \n\nVLC player doesnt play the MKV video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD -R disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and LG BP620 3D BluRay player does.\n\nEnjoy the TNA Impact show wrestling fans and thanks for downloading my TNA Impact HDTV 2012-12-06 720p H264 AVCHD-SC-SDH release.\n\n\nUploaded by SCSA420 on ThePirateBay.se and KickAss Torrents\n\n\nThis show is dedicated to my Uncle Don who is in the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital currently and may not make it much longer. He took me to my 1st live wrestling show when I was only 6 years old and to this day I still remember it. Please pray for him if you can and enjoy this show.
