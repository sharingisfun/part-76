The event broadcast by TV Globo and in the first year by TV Rio - and competed with Festival of MPB's Record - left a huge legacy. The most obvious are the MPB classics as &quot;Saveiros&quot;, &quot;Carolina&quot;, &quot;SabiÃƒÂ¡&quot;, &quot;AndanÃƒÂ§a&quot;, &quot;Pra NÃƒÂ£o Dizer Que NÃƒÂ£o Falei das Flores&quot;, &quot;BR-3&quot;, &quot;Fio Maravilha&quot;, &quot;Casa No Campo &quot;. There are also revelatory moments of aesthetic and political tensions of the time, as the boos Nana Caymmi (&quot;Saveiros&quot;), Tom Jobim and Chico Buarque (&quot;SabiÃƒÂ¡&quot;), Jards MacalÃƒÂ© (&quot;Gotham City&quot;) and Caetano Veloso (&quot;Ãƒâ€° Proibido Proibir&quot;).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea7823a0c8c40784c8ebcd71245d194908101fb","amp;dn":"Festivais+da+Cancao+Vol.+2+%281969%2F72%29+%5BV0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea7823a0c8c40784c8ebcd71245d194908101fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,167,130,58,12,140,64,120,76,142,188,215,18,69,209,148,144,129,1,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
