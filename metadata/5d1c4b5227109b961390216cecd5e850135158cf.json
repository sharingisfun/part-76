Locked files are undeletable, unrenamable, unmovable, hidden, and inaccessible. You can lock, scramble, or encrypt depending on speed and security. Folder Lock is fully portable, so you can protect your files on USB flash drives, disks, CD-RWs, notebooks, and hard disks, and it doesn't require installation on another PC. Folder Lock protects files in Windows, DOS, and Safe modes, even when you change your OS or boot from a disk. Folder Lock doesn't let you delete its own program folder, and it can't be uninstalled without the correct password. Additional options include Stealth Mode, Hacker Attempt Monitoring, Shred files, AutoLock, Auto Shutdown PC, Lock your PC, Erase PC tracks, 256-bit Blowfish Encryption and Context Menu in Explorer.\n\nWindows 8 / 7 / Vista / XP (32/64-bit)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d1c4b5227109b961390216cecd5e850135158cf","amp;dn":"NewSoftware+Folder+Lock+7.1.8%2Bkeys+by+Senzati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d1c4b5227109b961390216cecd5e850135158cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,28,75,82,39,16,155,150,19,144,33,108,236,213,232,80,19,81,88,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
