Bands have the option of bringing their own studio recordings or recording an acoustic set live in the radio station, and sit for interview segments to introduce the band and music.\n\nLAME chose to record live in-studio, and we hope you find the results as excellent as we did.  This performance is absolutely live, no dubs, no correction, exactly as heard in the studio on the night.  \n\nTracks: \n\n1. Interview 1\n2. She Lies\n3. Interview 2\n4. Lou-Evil\n5. Interview 3\n6.
