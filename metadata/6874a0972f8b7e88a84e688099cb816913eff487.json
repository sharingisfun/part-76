He lies in a hospital bed in a fate worse than death --- a quadruple amputee who has lost his arms, legs, eyes, ears, mouth and nose. He remains conscious and able to think, thereby reliving his life through strange dreams and memories, unable to distinguish whether he is awake or dreaming. He remains frustrated by his situation, until one day when Joe discovers a unique way to communicate with his caregivers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6874a0972f8b7e88a84e688099cb816913eff487","amp;dn":"Johnny+Got+His+Gun+1971+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6874a0972f8b7e88a84e688099cb816913eff487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,116,160,151,47,139,126,136,168,78,104,128,153,203,129,105,19,239,244,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
