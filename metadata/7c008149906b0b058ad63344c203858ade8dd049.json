Though the album prominently featured some of the era's best producers, only one other emcee was invited to appear on a song. That artist was AZ, and with one incredible verse on &quot;Life's a Bitch,&quot; he instantly became one of the leading artists of New York's Hip Hop golden age in the mid-90s. His 1995 debut disc Doe or Die would solidify his claim to legendary status, and now, 15 years later, AZ returns to deliver an expanded, reimagined version of that classic album for a new generation of fans to discover. In addition to new versions of &quot;Rather Unique,&quot; &quot;Sugar Hill,&quot; and &quot;Gimme Yours,&quot; AZ contributes five all-new songs with production from East Coast heavyweights such as Pete Rock, Statik Selektah, and L.E.S., among others. Not simply a rehashed effort, Doe or Die 15th Anniversary Special Edition revives all the elements that made the original an undisputed masterpiece, while delivering new music from an artist still in his prime.\n\n01. Tribute (Intro)\n02. Feel My Pain\n03. Gimmie Yours 2010\n04. Nothing Move feat. June Summers\n05. Rather Unique 2010\n06. The Calm\n07. Your World Don't Stop 2010\n08. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Ill\n09. I Feel 4 U 2010\n10. Bonus\n\nDO NOT move this release under the Doe or Die umbrella. It's a tribute CD, not re-release, containing a completely different tracklisting and songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c008149906b0b058ad63344c203858ade8dd049","amp;dn":"Doe+or+Die+15th+Anniversary+%5B2010%5D+%5BAnthology%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c008149906b0b058ad63344c203858ade8dd049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,0,129,73,144,107,11,5,138,214,51,68,194,3,133,138,222,141,208,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
