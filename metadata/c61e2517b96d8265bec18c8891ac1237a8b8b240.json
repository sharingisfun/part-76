A decade-long celebration of growth and power, fueled by the victory in WWII. Based on Pulitzer Prize winner David Halbertstam's bestselling book, this lively series casts a nostalgic eye back on the years of Ozzie and Harriet and the Hula Hoop, years which nonetheless paved the way for the turmoil of the decades to follow. From Sputnik to Elvis, bobby-socks to the Kinsey Report, DAVID HALBERTSTAM'S THE FIFTIES is a breathtaking collage of the people, music, memories, fads and issues that sent the first Baby Boomers on their way. Countless interviews, clips from landmark TV shows and movies and specially-produced music videos set to original '50's hits capture the intense tapestry of optimism and fear, repression and discovery that was THE FIFTIES.\n\n\nEpisode 6 - The Beat\n\nJack Kerouac's &quot;On The Road&quot; and Allen Ginsberg's &quot;Howl&quot; challenge America's materialism and conformity and usher in the &quot;Beat Generation&quot; at the same time that a young man from Memphis named Elvis Presley mesmorizes restless teenagers with a new kind of music. See how the Beats' search for a less materialistic, more spiritual America and the rise of  rock 'n' roll helped forge the youth culture that would explode in the 1960's.\n\n\n\nVideo \nVHSRip\nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP : 2 \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263) \nCodec ID : DX50 \nCodec ID/Hint : DivX 5 \nDuration : 54mn 13s \nBit rate : 3 523 Kbps \nWidth : 640 pixels \nHeight : 480 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3 \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nCompression mode : Lossy \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.383 \nStream size : 1.33 GiB (94%) \nWriting library : XviD 73 \n\nAudio \nID : 1 \nFormat : MPEG Audio \nFormat version : Version 1 \nFormat profile : Layer 3 \nCodec ID : 55 \nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \nDuration : 54mn 12s \nSource duration : 54mn 12s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 192 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 74.4 MiB (5%) \nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves \nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.72 video frame) \nWriting library : LAME3.98.4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c61e2517b96d8265bec18c8891ac1237a8b8b240","amp;dn":"History+Channel+-+David+Halberstam%27s+The+Fifties+%281997%29+-+Pt.+6+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c61e2517b96d8265bec18c8891ac1237a8b8b240","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,30,37,23,185,109,130,101,190,193,140,136,145,172,18,55,168,184,178,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
