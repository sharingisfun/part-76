Peace force. \n\nAlex also reviews the accelerating disintegration of Posse Comitatus as Americans are acclimated to accept Russian forces to provide &quot;security at mass events.&quot; \n\nWe'll also cover how riots may be on the horizon if George Zimmerman is acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin. \n\nOn today's show, Alex welcomes in studio guest NASA Mission Operations Control Room flight control monitor Raymond Teague who worked on the Apollo program. \n\nPublic Enemy's Professor Griff, the Minister of Information, is also in studio to discuss the Illuminati takeover of hip hop and to conduct a special Ask Alex segment.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
