Every body has a story to tell and Dr. Megan Hunt will find out what it is. Dr. Megan Hunt was a top neurosurgeon until a car accident ended her career as a surgeon. Now that she can no longer help the living, Dr. Hunt is Philadelphia's most notorious medical examiner. Although she's amazing at her job, Dr. Hunt's reputation of being difficult precedes her wherever she goes. She's never encountered a boundary that she wouldn't cross. Her powerful boss tries to protect her as long as she doesn't step too hard on the wrong toes. Although he grudgingly acknowledges her skill, seasoned police detective Bud Morris is not as enthralled with her methods. Luckily, Dr. Hunt does have a few fans. Her junior medical examiners rely on her expert advice and her investigative partner, Medical Investigator Peter Dunlap, accepts her unorthodox behavior. Maybe that's because he's the only one who knows that Dr. Hunt's challenging personality is partly rooted in guilt. Before she gave up neurosurgery, Dr. Hunt accidentally killed her last patient. Add in a touch of bitterness from a hostile divorce that awarded her ex sole custody of their teenage daughter and you have one sad social life. You see, when it comes to understanding the dead, Dr. Hunt is amazing. But when it comes to her relationships with the living, she has a lot of work to do. From executive producers Matt Gross and Christopher Murphey comes a fascinating new procedural built on a strong and compelling female lead. Each week, as Dr. Hunt and her colleagues close a new case, she will come a tiny step closer to letting other people into her life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77f166157839675eedef7b2d1d4bf8af731f275d","amp;dn":"Body.of.Proof.S03E13.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77f166157839675eedef7b2d1d4bf8af731f275d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,241,102,21,120,57,103,94,237,239,123,45,29,75,248,175,115,31,39,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
