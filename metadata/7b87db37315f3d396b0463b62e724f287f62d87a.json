And for four young Aboriginal \nsisters from a remote mission this is the year that would change their lives \nforever. Around the globe, there was protest and revolution in the streets. \nIndigenous Australians finally secured the right to vote. There were drugs and \nthe shock of a brutal assassination. And there was Vietnam. The sisters, \nCynthia, Gail, Julie and Kay are discovered by Dave, a talent scout with a kind \nheart, very little rhythm but a great knowledge of soul music. Billed as \nAustralia's answer to 'The Supremes', Dave secures the sisters their first true \ngig, and flies them to Vietnam to sing for the American troops. Based on a true \nstory, THE SAPPHIRES is a triumphant celebration of youthful emotion, family and \nmusic.\n\n\n\nSpecial Notes\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b87db37315f3d396b0463b62e724f287f62d87a","amp;dn":"The+Sapphires+%5B2012%5D+EngBrRipXvidAc3-GtpD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b87db37315f3d396b0463b62e724f287f62d87a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,135,219,55,49,95,61,57,107,4,99,182,46,114,79,40,127,98,216,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
