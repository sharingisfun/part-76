Feral's ports simply select control options and teach the controls to the games. \nHint: In order to enable all wheel functions, please also check out Feral's FreeTheWheel http://support.feralinteractive.com/files/freethewheel/FreeTheWheel.dmg\n\nKudos to the people at siniscope.com for figuring this out.
