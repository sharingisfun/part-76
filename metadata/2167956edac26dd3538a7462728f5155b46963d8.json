Crooked Special Deputy Charles Rakes is after a share of the brothers' profits. Compounding their troubles, the local competition is elbowing in on their activities. Forrest's boisterous defiance and Cricket's knack for moonshine production help the brothers gain a local monopoly. When Forrest is wounded as tension with Rakes escalates, Jack, initially the timid one, must prove his worth against gangster Floyd Banner's mob, and we see him metamorphose into a cocky exhibitionist in his attempts to woo the off-limits preacher's daughter, Bertha.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2167956edac26dd3538a7462728f5155b46963d8","amp;dn":"Lawless.2012.BRRip.XviD-3LT0N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2167956edac26dd3538a7462728f5155b46963d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,103,149,110,218,194,109,211,83,138,116,98,114,143,81,85,180,105,99,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
