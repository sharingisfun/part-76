If you don't read and default to just\ndownloading everything, you'll get more that you don't want than what you do.\nAgain, that's on your head - I've posted clear directions to HERE.\n.\nIf you just want to see quickly &quot;what's it all about&quot; (is it real?) do the 272p\nIf you trust me and want my usual quality, then the 352p is better by TWICE.\nIf you see everything is all right and want the original quality, Who am I to say no?\nI've tried u/l large files before, so I cannot say I'll continue 720p through all 13 eps.\n.\nThis is all from a Blu-ray rip, 720p is original, not mine - see NFO\n352p &amp; 272p are mine, all mine.\n1280x720 is (5200Kbps Video) (1500Kbps 48KHz 24bit 6ch DTS audio) 2.18GB\n624x352 is double my usual bit rate (1536Kbps video) and (160Kbps/48KHz audio) \n480x272 is 1/4 my usual bit rate (192Kbps video) and (48Kbps/22KHz audio) 86MB\n.\nAny complaints about the 720p has nothing to do with me, I'm just the distributor.\nAny comments about the other two are highly encouraged - tell me what you think.\n.\nEpGuides says the first episode is due to air 20130104 heh ...\nIMDB says some episodes have already aired. I cannot confirm or deny this.\nCan't find season 2 on Amazon or TPB. So, maybe, I've done a good thing here.\nMaybe not. I've viewed the first ep in 272p &amp; 352p and see no problems.\n.\nSo, with all that in mind ... Enjoy!\n.\nAVIGUY\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ba1c89464a90097b23b375bf296978dc0029cb8","amp;dn":"XIII.The.Series.S02E01.%28READ+DESC%21%21%21%29+%283+quality+choices%29+%281+tor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ba1c89464a90097b23b375bf296978dc0029cb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,161,200,148,100,169,0,151,178,59,55,91,242,150,151,141,192,2,156,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
