In three days, an epic journey will unfold through a web of suspicion, treason, song and dance, cruel scientific experiments, storytelling, sadistic scientists, petulant generals, cold and distant lovers and of course the odd glass of Poitin. \n\nMarcos is the philosophical leader of a community trying to re-establish humanity. Since the blackout, the human population has dwindled and a famine plagues the conscious minds of those left behind by a failed industry. The Nest (the remnants of an old Ford assembly plant) is home to The Collective; whose sole focus is to re-learn love to save mankind.\n\nAfter a century of dehumanisation, technological dependence and mal-communication, humanity lost its empathy. At the end of the age of oil, the engines stopped. At the end of the age of information, identity stopped and in the age of famine, mankind stopped. Nature had removed the empathy gene from man, the gene that preserves existence linking man to man, man to nature and man to god. Without the gene, women could no longer bond with their new born children. Unable to lactate, unwilling to care, the mothers left their infants to starve to death and the depletion of human production began.\n\nThe Collective, led by Marcos, occupy downtown and pacify the potentially violent and unpredictable famined by feeding them information to quiet the hunger in their minds much like an apocalyptic methadone clinic. Inside the Nest they work to re-learn the empathy gene with the children they collect from the streets and the Child Markets; run by a drunken old Irishman and his ancient story telling mother.\n\nIn the days leading to the fall of the Nest, Marcos and his lover; The Woman, start to delve into delusion and dream, thinking they are falling into famine. His suspicion will unravel a treason that will set in motion, the fall of one idea for the betterment of another, as begins the march towards a new frontier, towards the city of light and sound, towards New Utopia.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Love as one; Live as you loveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nby  Irish philosopher/artist, C.
