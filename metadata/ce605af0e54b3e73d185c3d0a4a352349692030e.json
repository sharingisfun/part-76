This fixture has provided much drama over the years, and last season's clash was no different as Arsenal battled back from 2-0 down to thrash their bitter rivals 5-2.\n\nManchester United faced a difficult trip to play Norwich. Although the Canaries endured a tough start to the season, they enjoyed a superb win over Arsenal and showed that winning at Carrow Road will not be easy for any side. Last season it took a 90th minute goal from Ryan Giggs on his 900th appearance for Manchester United to see off Norwich 2-1.\n\nElsewhere, champions Manchester City hosted Aston Villa, who beat them at the Etihad Stadium recently in the League Cup, Chelsea visited West Brom, Liverpool hosted Wigan, Newcastle took on Swansea, QPR welcomed Southampton and Reading played Everton at the Madejski Stadium.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce605af0e54b3e73d185c3d0a4a352349692030e","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+17.11.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce605af0e54b3e73d185c3d0a4a352349692030e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,96,90,240,229,75,62,115,209,133,195,208,164,163,82,52,150,146,3,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
