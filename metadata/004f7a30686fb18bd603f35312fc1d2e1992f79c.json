IT IS A GREAT CD (UP THERE WITH 'TIMELESS' BY GOLDIE, IMO.)\n\nENJOY THIS EXCELLENT CD AND AS ALWAYS, IF YOU LIKE IT... BUY THE CD!\n\n\nDESCRIPTION/REVIEW:\n\nGrooverider isn't hailed as the &quot;don of drum &amp; bass&quot; for nothing. It's an honorable title that he has earned and held since the genre's very foundation in the early 1990s. Mysteries of Funk, surprisingly Groove's first full-length, is a sample of jazzier and more tech-step-oriented strains of drum &amp; bass. Taking slightly forced, BjÃƒÂ¶rk-esque vocal arrangements and beautiful guitar licks and arranging them around soft, cafÃƒÂ©-style breakbeats, &quot;Rainbow of Color&quot; emphasizes the jazz-funk solution to Groove's great mystery. &quot;On the Double&quot; takes the fusion of sound even more literally and exercises a more soundtrackish approach with a film chase-scene sound. The mighty Grooverider later flees the cafÃƒÂ© scene with a handful of strictly main-floor tracks like &quot;Where's Jack the Ripper?&quot; and &quot;560.&quot; The former takes crunchy bass quacks and pounds against them with a metallic snare drum; the latter takes quirky sub-bass pulses that are quickly recycled into heavy reverb while a simple conga rhythm accents each beat. Groovy. --Daniel Shumate\n\n\n\nCybernetic Jazz\t                1:58\t\t\nRainbows of Colour              4:20\nOn the Double\t                4:05\nTime &amp; Space\t                7:14\nWhere's Jack the Ripper\t        8:09\nFly With Me\t                9:14\t\nC Funk\t                        7:42\nImagination - parts I and II\t8:27\nRivers of Congo \t        7:00\t\nImagination - part III\t        4:57\t\n560Ã‚Â°\t                        5:42\n\n\n\n**NOTE**\n\nI will seed this for as long as I can, but understand that there will be times when I am not available, so everyone else please seed to at least 1:1!\n\nThanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004f7a30686fb18bd603f35312fc1d2e1992f79c","amp;dn":"Mysteries+of+Funk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004f7a30686fb18bd603f35312fc1d2e1992f79c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,79,122,48,104,111,177,139,214,3,243,83,18,252,29,46,25,146,247,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
