At an early age being influenced by hip hop icons such as Nas and Snoop Dogg Terry found the inspiration to perform. But, it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t until hearing TupacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hit song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dear MamaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that he penned his first rhyme. After successfully winning over his peers with his new found gift of writing and performing, his elementary school teacher invited him on a mini elementary school tour within the school district to promote anti-violence and drug use. Terry Hill growing up in the inner-city around dope, gangs, and prostitution realized that this was going to be his platform to influence change.\n\nAt the age of 15, Terry Hill moved to Atlanta, Georgia to take his music career to the next level. After recording a professional demo and shopping it to reputable record labels such as Def Jam, So So Def, and Slip NÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Slide he felt he had to bring his new passion and experiences back home to Seattle. Since then Terry Hill has successfully performed at dozens of venues, put together and distributed a successful mix-tape, featured on many local projects.\n\nCurrently recording a three album series entitled the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pre-AlbumÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The Pre-Album Volume 1 is titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Already A ClassicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released July 1st, 2006 and has sold over 12,000 copies. It features Kube 93Ã¢â‚¬Â²s Eddie Francis and songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rattle In Da TrunkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“These StreetsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ have received great reviews. The Pre-Album Volume 2 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Born LeaderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ highlighted 80Ã¢â‚¬Â²s babyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s versatility and broaden his audience with tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Remember MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Self defenseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The leading singles titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Knock It OffÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Doin Da DoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ heated up the airwaves both having very catchy chores and easy to memorize verses. The Pre-Album Volume 2 was released in May of 2007.\n\nNow 2009 Terry Hill is back with Pre-album Chapter 3 titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“One WayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. From Gameboy to 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Baby we now have Juga Hill. The album features some of the northwestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best local talent as well as Freeway on the hit single Ã¢â‚¬Å“MushinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. With over 70,000 units sold to date the road to greatness looks closer with this release.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not an accident that Terry Hill was given his gifts and talents but through his determination, and hard work he will make his mark in the record industry and beyond becoming a positive figure in many communities and a voice of change across the globe.\n\n1.
