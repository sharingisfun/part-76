Despite its title, it is not a direct adaptation of Peter David, Todd Dezago and Todd Nauck's Young Justice comic series, but rather an adaptation of the entire DC Universe with a focus on young superheroes.[3][4] The series follows the lives of teenaged heroes and sidekicks who are members of a fictional covert operation group called the Team. The Team is essentially a young counterpart to the famous adult team, the Justice League.[5][6] The main setting is the fictional universe of Earth-16,[5] during a time period in which superheroes are a relatively recent phenomenon.[7] The series debuted with an hour long special on November 26, 2010 with the airing of the first two episodes, 'Independence Day' and 'Fireworks'.[8][9][10] Young Justice premiered on September 9, 2011 on Teletoon, in","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:591bb9f40b66cf1d0bf4561259c09de40b96df6a","amp;dn":"YOUNG+JUSTICE+%5BVERIFIED-VIDZ%5D%5BSEASON+1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"591bb9f40b66cf1d0bf4561259c09de40b96df6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,27,185,244,11,102,207,29,11,244,86,18,89,192,157,228,11,150,223,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
