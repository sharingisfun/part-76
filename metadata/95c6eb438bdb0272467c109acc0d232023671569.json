The reason being is simple: with torrents you have to wait for the seeders to accumulate. With mIRC you're downloading directly from the servers. \n\nYou can run multiple servers and channels at the same time giving you a monster klipper list of files. Think thousands. You can also search from the klipper windows. \n\nFrom the command line on the server page remember this line /server -m &lt;----- the &quot;/&quot; is already there, no need to type it again. Anyway, after you type server -m hit space then enter the server you want to add. Like /server -m irc.rizon.net as an example. Rizon used to be a good one, but not any more. That's just an example. If you forget the &quot;-m&quot; it will exit the server you're on and open the new server. With -m it will keep that server and open a new one.\n\nI put a list of servers in the folder also. Sometimes you have to resolve the server address to the ip address. I'm not sure why, but it would be something like /server -m 65.23.158.132 then hit enter.\n\nThe list is the file that says something like irc server list 2009 updated. I checked some of them, but not all. If I made a note like &quot;good server&quot; it has a ton of channels. Since it's from my local folder it might have my settings saved for various servers so channels might open automatically. If so, they're the channels with the most files.\n\nWatch the Powerpoint on it.
