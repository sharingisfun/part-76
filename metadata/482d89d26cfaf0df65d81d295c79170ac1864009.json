Strong characters and intriguing plots helped to set Bonanza apart from the usual gun-slinging formula shows of its heyday.\n\nOne reason for Bonanza's success was the show's attention to script development. The characters were allowed to grow and evolve; story lines crossed into controversial topics, exploring racial tension, domestic violence and substance abuse. \nEach of the Cartwright men developed relationships with women on the show; although almost every woman that came into their lives died tragically.\n\nWhen it premiered on NBC Sept. 12, 1959, Bonanza was not an immediate ratings winner, but the show remained on the air due to the fact that it was one of few shows filmed in color. After barely surviving its first two seasons on Saturday nights, the show moved to Sunday and became a hit: It was the No. 1 show four years in a row from 1964 to 1967. In 10 of its 14 years on the air, Bonanza was in the national Top 10 -- quite a comeback for those Cartwrights.\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: Dutch\n\nThe cast\n\n[img]http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b187/vivitronl/Het%20Multimedia%20Cafe%20Afbeeldingen/Serie%20Screenshot/220px-Lorne_Greene_in_Bonanza_opening_credit_episode_Bitter_Water.jpg[/img]\nLorne Greene as Ben Cartwright\n\n[img]http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b187/vivitronl/Het%20Multimedia%20Cafe%20Afbeeldingen/Serie%20Screenshot/220px-Pernell_Roberts_in_Bonanza_opening_credits_episode_Bitter_Water.jpg[/img]\nPernell Roberts as Adam Cartwright\n\n[img]http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b187/vivitronl/Het%20Multimedia%20Cafe%20Afbeeldingen/Serie%20Screenshot/220px-Dan_Blocker_in_Bonanza_opening_credits_episode_Bitter_Water.jpg[/img]\nDan Blocker as 'Hoss' Cartwright\n\n[img]http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b187/vivitronl/Het%20Multimedia%20Cafe%20Afbeeldingen/Serie%20Screenshot/220px-Michael_Landon_in_Bonanza_opening_credits_episode_Bitter_Water.jpg[/img]\nMichael Landon as 'Little Joe' Cartwright;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:482d89d26cfaf0df65d81d295c79170ac1864009","amp;dn":"Bonanza+Collectors+Edition+14-15+DutchReleaseTeam-DVDRIP-NLSubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"482d89d26cfaf0df65d81d295c79170ac1864009","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,45,137,210,108,250,240,223,101,216,29,41,92,121,23,10,193,134,64,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
