His paintings explore death in its most graphic and ugly forms in hopes of helping him transcend it and ultimately become its master. His art is similarly gruesome and disturbing. One of his more famous pieces has him wired with explosives and biting the heads off live mice. This documentary from Austrian filmmaker Robert-Adrian Pejo paints a fascinating, intimate portrait of this complex man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f09da98b4bfb403f423f732dca4e9608964eeb1","amp;dn":"R.I.P.+Rest+In+Pieces.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f09da98b4bfb403f423f732dca4e9608964eeb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,9,218,152,180,191,180,3,244,35,247,50,220,164,233,96,137,100,238,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
