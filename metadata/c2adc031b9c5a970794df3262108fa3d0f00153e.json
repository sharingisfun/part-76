However, it's just the first chapter that redefines the borders between rock and electronic and crosses them at the same time. When consistently joining opposites the question arises: what comes next?\nLike an acoustic parasite creeping through your head it leaves traces that will make you curious in digging deeper until you are trapped and become a &quot;Paraseeder&quot; for yourself.\nIn that moment you will find out that it correlates with your personality than the things that were usually presented to you.\nWhen you take your time to listen to this album you should gain a new experience of listening that allowsÃ‚Â  you to immerse yourself into another world.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\ndetails and artwork:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Paraseed-Earworms/release/4094254&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Paraseed-Earworms/release/4094254&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/release/265a08fa-20b2-4dc3-b1f7-750e665a52ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/release/265a08fa-20b2-4dc3-b1f7-750e665a52ca&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2adc031b9c5a970794df3262108fa3d0f00153e","amp;dn":"Paraseed+-+Earworms+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2adc031b9c5a970794df3262108fa3d0f00153e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,173,192,49,185,197,169,112,121,77,243,38,33,8,250,61,15,0,21,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
