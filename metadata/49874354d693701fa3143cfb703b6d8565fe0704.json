With the Nerve Gear, a virtual reality Helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. On November 6, 2022, all the players log in for the first time, and subsequently discover that they are unable to log out. They are then informed by Kayaba Akihiko, the creator of SAO, that if they wish to be free and log out of the game, they must reach the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss. However, if their avatars die in-game, their bodies will also die in the real world. The story follows Kirito, a skilled player who is determined to beat the game.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49874354d693701fa3143cfb703b6d8565fe0704","amp;dn":"sword+art+online+1+-25","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49874354d693701fa3143cfb703b6d8565fe0704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,135,67,84,214,147,112,31,163,20,60,251,112,59,109,133,101,254,7,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
