Each successful theory is exclusively concerned about &quot;results of measurement&quot;. Quantum mechanics point of view is completely different from classical physics in measurement, because in microscopic world of quantum mechanics, a direct measurement as classical form is impossible. Therefore, over the years of developments of quantum mechanics, always challenging part of quantum mechanics lies in measurements. This book has been written by an international invited group of authors and it is created to clarify different interpretation about measurement in quantum mechanics.\n\nTitle: Measurements in Quantum Mechanics\nAuthor: Mohammad Reza Pahlavani\nPublisher: InTech\nYear: 2012\nFormat: PDF\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
