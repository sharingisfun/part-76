Like its better-known competitors, the free 7-Zip unpacks a host of archive formats, including ZIP, TAR, GZ, and its own 7z format. Unlike WinZip, though, it can create TAR and GZ archives, which are commonly used on Unix and Linux systems.\nThe program's ability to shrink files was stunning. In our tests, 7z archives were up to 40 percent smaller then their ZIP equivalents, although compression did take longer, and the highest compression settings can hog system resources. Advanced options include the ability to create solid and self-extracting archives, and to adjust the compression level and password protection. The program also has a command line module. Though the main interface is overly simple and looks like it was designed for Windows 95, it's not hard to use and fairly self-explanatory. The context menu options, which include &quot;testing&quot; an archive, indicate that 7-Zip should be taken seriously.\n7-Zip is fine for casual users with a bit of computer savvy, but it's especially well-suited for developers and anyone else who moves between the Windows and Linux/Unix worlds.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\n\n\nSupports\n===================================================================================\nSupports Various Compression File Types\n7-Zip is able to support 7z, XZ, BZIP2, GZIP, TAR, ZIP, WIM, ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, CramFS, DEB, DMG, FAT, HFS, ISO, LZH, LZMA, MBR, MSI, NSIS, NTFS, RAR, RPM, SquashFS, UDF, VHD, WIM, XAR, Z file, and many more!\n\n\nTechnical\n===================================================================================\nTitle: 7z925-x64.exe (Or just 7z925.exe for x32)\nRequires: Windows 7 / Vista / XP / 2008 / 2003 / 2000 / NT / ME / 98\nHardware requirements: None (Well, have a functioning PC)\n\n\nTested On\n===================================================================================\nWindows 7 64-Bit and Windows XP X64, by me.\n\n\nAs always, seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2514481accb95ba7ba83066df1a036da9e9e8f89","amp;dn":"7+Zip+9.25A+%282011-09-16%29+x64+x32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2514481accb95ba7ba83066df1a036da9e9e8f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,20,72,26,204,185,91,167,186,131,6,109,241,160,54,218,158,158,143,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
