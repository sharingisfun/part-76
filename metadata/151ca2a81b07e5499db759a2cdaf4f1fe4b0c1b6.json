Fabrice BrÃƒÂ©gier, President and CEO of the EUROCOPTER Group, world leading helicopter manufacturer, immediately congratulated the pilot and his team for this extraordinary feat.\n \nAfter taking off from its base camp Lukla on May 14th, 2005 at 2,866 meters (9,403ft) Didier Delsalle onboard his Ecureuil AS350B3 reached the top of Mount Everest. As required by the FÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ration AÃƒÂ©ronautique Internationale (FAI - International Aeronautical Federation), the aircraft remained landed on ground more than 2 minutes on the top of the world before flying back to Lukla.\n \nThis feat was renewed the day after.\n \nStepping out of his helicopter, Didier Delsalle commented: &quot;To reach this mythical summit definitively seemed to be a dream; despite the obvious difficulties of the target to be reached, the aircraft demonstrated its capability to cope with the situation (Ã¢â‚¬Â¦), sublimated by the magic of the placeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n \nAchieved with a serial helicopter, this absolute World Record once more contributes to underline the unique qualities of the Ecureuil/AStar AS350 B3 as a multipurpose, reliable, quick and comfortable helicopter which emerges as the most performing aircraft in the world in the most extreme conditions.\n \nDuring the trial period, Didier Delsalle and his Ecureuil/AStar AS350 B3 flew some rescue missions on behalf of the Nepalese authorities demonstrating the operational capabilities of the aircraft used to set the altitude landing and take-off World Record.\n \nThis feat has been achieved further to various flight tests begun one year ago with the Ecureuil/AStar AS350 B3 among which:\n \n-          Experimental flight up to 8,992 meters (29,500 ft) in April 2004 in Istres (France),\n \n-          Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time to climbÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ records to the heights of 3,000, 6,000 and 9,000 meters performed on April 14th, 2005 in respectively 2 minutes 21 seconds, 5 minutes 6 seconds and 9 minutes 26 seconds. These records smash the previous ones held by an Ecureuil/AStar AS350 B1 with respectively 2 minutes 59 seconds, 6 minutes 55 seconds and 13 minutes 52 seconds,\n \n-          Experimental flight up to 10.211 meters (33.500 ft) on April 14, 2005,\n \n-          Landing at the South Pass of Mount Everest at 7,925 meters (26,000 ft) on May 12th, 2005, establishing a new altitude landing and take-off record, previously held by a Cheetah helicopter - variant of the Lama - at 7,670 meters (25,150 ft).\n \nWith this landing on the top of the world, EUROCOPTER demonstrates that its technological innovations provide its products a length - height - ahead, set at the disposal of its worldwide customers.\n \nTo date, 3,670 Ecureuil/AStar have been sold worldwide and logged 15 million flight hours. Since its introduction on the market, the Ecureuil/AStar/Twinstar family has been benefiting of successive improvements among which its most powerful version is the Ecureuil/AStar AS350 B3. This aircraft is serial equipped with modern systems such as dual channel FADEC, Vehicule and Engine Monitoring Display, integrated GPS, etcÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. 424 Ecureuil/AStar AS350 B3 are currently in operation worldwide, mainly used for missions requiring high performances, such as aerial work (cargo sling capacity: 1,400kg) in very high and hot conditions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:151ca2a81b07e5499db759a2cdaf4f1fe4b0c1b6","amp;dn":"The+Mystery+Chopper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"151ca2a81b07e5499db759a2cdaf4f1fe4b0c1b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,28,162,168,27,7,229,73,157,183,89,162,205,175,79,31,228,176,193,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
