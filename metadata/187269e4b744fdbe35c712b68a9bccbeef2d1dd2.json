Surprising since it has a 8.0 rating on imdb\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033045/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033045/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStoryline\n\nIn Budapest, Hungary, the Matuschek and Company store is owned by Mr. Hugo Matuschek and the bachelor Alfred Kralik is his best and most experienced salesman. When Klara Novak seeks a job position of saleswoman in the store, Matuschek hires her but Kralik and she do not tolerate each other. Meanwhile the lonely and dedicated Kralik has an unknown pen pal that he intends to propose very soon; however, he is fired without explanation by Matuschek in the night that he is going to meet his secret love. He goes to the bar where they have scheduled their meeting with his colleague Pirovitch and he surprisingly finds that Klara is his correspondent; however, ashamed with the unemployment, he does not disclose his identity to her. When Matuschek discovers that he had misjudged Kralik and committed a mistake, he hires him again for the position of manager. But Klara is still fascinated with her future fiancÃƒÂ© and does not pay much attention to Kralik. \n\nUser Review\n\nMuch about love &amp; life can be learned from watching the folks at THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.\n\nErnst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film. With sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie. Always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive, enigmatic quality known as the Ã¢â‚¬ËœLubitsch touch.'\n\nAlthough the story is set in Budapest (and there is a jumble of accents among the players) this is of no consequence. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great American city or small town could easily be the locus for the action.\n\nJimmy Stewart &amp; Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other - without knowing it. Their dialogue - so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural - perfectly conveys their confusion &amp; quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates. Theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:187269e4b744fdbe35c712b68a9bccbeef2d1dd2","amp;dn":"Shop+around+the+Cornor%2C+The+%7BJ%2C+Stewart%7D+%5B1940%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"187269e4b744fdbe35c712b68a9bccbeef2d1dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,114,105,228,183,68,253,190,53,199,18,182,138,155,204,190,239,45,29,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
