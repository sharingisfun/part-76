Blue Planet included.\nSCP 3.7.0 offers new graphical features, less bugs, and greater stability.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Open up FS2 launcher (icon looks like a paw). On the top right corner, press &quot;BROWSE&quot;. Select &quot;fs2_open_3_7_0_RC2&quot; to play Freespace 2, or &quot;fs2_open_3_6_19_SSE2_BP&quot; SPECIFICALLY if you want to play Blue Planet.\n\n2. Go to Mods tab, and select mod &quot;3.6.12 Media_VP&quot; to play Freespace 2 with upgraded graphics, FSPort to play Freespace 1, or Blue Planet/Blue Planet 2 to play the great community created campaign which feels like Freespace 3.\n\n3. Go to Video tab, and optimize your resolution. Make sure the graphics are at their highest.\n\n4. Go to Features tab, and make sure every graphics and HUD feature is enabled. Go to Experimental subsection and make sure &quot;Framebuffer Shockwaves&quot; is checked. If they are giving you problems, you can disable them.\n\n5. Launch Game. Create a new pilot and type in a callsign.\n\n6.Go to Options ingame, and turn all the graphics to maximum. Turn up the mouse sensitivity to maximum. You can customize your flight controls, as well as your HUD to your liking (recommended).\n\n7. Go to Campaigns and make sure the Campaign you want to play is loaded. For Blue Planet, play Age of Aquarius first, War in Heaven Part 1 as second, and War in Heaven Part 2 last. There are bonus campaigns for some mods. &quot;Kill Everything&quot; campaign can be ignored (it was my own creation).\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa53e743964856126f5c515ab433dde332b7f267","amp;dn":"Freespace+2+SCP+3.7.0+%2B+Blue+Planet+AoA+%26amp%3B+WiH+Part+I-II+%2B+Ot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa53e743964856126f5c515ab433dde332b7f267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,83,231,67,150,72,86,18,111,92,81,90,180,51,221,227,50,183,242,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
