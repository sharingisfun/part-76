And we are not free to redefine how He has sent us out, but we are to be sent out in the same pattern that He was.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI Hear the Rumbling - Walter Veith 5-16-2011:\nWalter Veith, I Hear the Rumbling, 5-16-2011. (Recorded during the visit of Francois du Plessis and Walter Veith to southern California. Sponsored by the Beaumont Seventh-day Adventist Church and presented at the Loma Linda Filipino Church.)\n\nMessage written by original uploader... The time is shorter than I realized. What I gleaned from Veith's sermon is that we need to prepare NOW, not tomorrow, but asap. I will pray for the Lord's guidance in what I need to do to get my family ready. Neighbors, co-workers ... all need the light of Jesus Christ. There is so much to do! No time to play games on FB anymore. Let's pray for the gift of the Holy Spirit, who will teach us what to do and what to say. Thank you Walter Veith for this incredible vid. God bless you!\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEvolution  Fact of Fiction  - Dr Adrian Rogers:\nThe Theory of Evolution Destroyed!!

Now she knows.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n\n                                           \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d568587ceb992571b94fcfb31fc6b61971abb06","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Apostasy+The+Great+Falling+Away+Vol+18+-+Living+Out+Prew","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d568587ceb992571b94fcfb31fc6b61971abb06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,86,133,135,206,185,146,87,27,148,252,251,49,252,107,97,151,26,187,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
