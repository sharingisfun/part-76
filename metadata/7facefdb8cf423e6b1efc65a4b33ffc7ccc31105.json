These rows signaled the whereabouts of the Ds and tended to eat up a disproportionate space of the singles section. In 2004, the Mute label condensed all of these releases into Remixes 81-04, which itself was ironically (or fittingly) presented in multiple versions. This particular version is a triple-disc set that attempts to function as a representative sampling of Depeche Mode's innumerable remixes. It does an admirable job, making a point to highlight glorified extended versions and radical reworkings alike.\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n1   Never Let Me Down (Split Mix) \t                                  9:31\n2   Policy of Truth (Capitol Mix) \t                                  8:00\n3   Shout!
