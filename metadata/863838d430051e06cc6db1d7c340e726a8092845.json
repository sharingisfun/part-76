This piece is scored entirely for percussion, except that there seems to be a synth at the beginning and end.\n\nThe dance that accompanies this describe a toyshop closing at nightfall, at which the toys come out. The dolls revolt against the tin soldiers, the the tanks move in. Come daybreak, the shocked owner finds only broken pieces.\n\nThe sheer violence of the music matches the story, and should be played at full volume. You'll have to imagine the action; the versions on youtube either change the story, or just aren't very good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:863838d430051e06cc6db1d7c340e726a8092845","amp;dn":"Istvan+Marta+-+Babah%26aacute%3Bzi+T%26ouml%3Brt%26eacute%3Bnete+-+A+Doll%27s+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"863838d430051e06cc6db1d7c340e726a8092845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,56,56,212,48,5,30,6,204,109,177,215,195,64,231,38,168,9,40,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
