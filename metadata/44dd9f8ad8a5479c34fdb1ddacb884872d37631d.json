Time warped means the \n\naudio is played 38% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 \n\nminutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG \n\naoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\n\nGuests: Ari Shaffir\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44dd9f8ad8a5479c34fdb1ddacb884872d37631d","amp;dn":"JRE+%23294+-+Ari+Shaffir%2C+Brian+Redban+%5B64k+Time+Warped%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44dd9f8ad8a5479c34fdb1ddacb884872d37631d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,221,159,138,216,165,71,156,52,253,177,221,172,184,132,135,45,55,99,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
