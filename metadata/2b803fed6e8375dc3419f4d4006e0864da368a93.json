We'll review Bill O'Reilly's subliminal propaganda piece, subtly demonizing Alex Jones as &quot;hate speech.&quot; We'll also hear from two of the most bold citizen journalists and activists of our time: author and social analyst Mark Dice, whose videos have exposed America's zombie-like mental state, and We Are Change reporter Luke Rudkowski, who recently confronted globalist minion Henry Kissinger. Joel Skousen, author of The Secure Home and Strategic Relocation, consultant and editor of World Affairs Brief also gives key analysis of Benghazi-gate and the IRS scandal.\n\nThis pre-recorded broadcast consists largely of previously aired material.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
