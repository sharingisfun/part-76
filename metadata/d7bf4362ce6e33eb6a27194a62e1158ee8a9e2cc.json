Now Frances and her daughter, Anna, pick up where Diet for a Small Planet left off. Together they set out on an around-the-world journey to explore the greatest challenges we face in the new millennium. Traveling to Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, they discovered answers to one of the most urgent issues of our time: whether we can transcend the rampant consumerism and capitalism to find the paths that each of us can follow to heal our lives as well as the planet.\n\nFeaturing nearly seventy recipes from celebrated vegetarian culinary pioneers-including Alice Waters, Mollie Katzen, Laurel Robertson, Nora Pouillon, and Anna Thomas-Hope's Edge highlights true trailblazers engaged in social, environmental, and economic transformations.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7bf4362ce6e33eb6a27194a62e1158ee8a9e2cc","amp;dn":"Hope%27s+Edge%3A+The+Next+Diet+for+a+Small+Planet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7bf4362ce6e33eb6a27194a62e1158ee8a9e2cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,191,67,98,206,110,51,235,106,39,25,74,98,225,21,142,232,169,226,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
