The mighty kingdoms of\nSpain, England, France and the Netherlands fight over the colonies.\nAnd there you are, a young sea captain whose only goal is to become\nthe most powerful man in the New World. To achieve that goal, you may\nchoose one of the two available campaigns: will you become an Adventurer\nor a Trader? If you chose the way of the Adventurer, lead an unforgiving campaign\nfor the conquest of the seas: invasion, piracy, bounty hunting, raiding;\ndo whatever it takes to build your own empire in the Caribbean. And of\ncourse, trade will have a less important role to play in your rise.\nThe way of the Trader is, on the opposite, mostly about developing your\nriches and your economic power. To be the most powerful Trader of the\nNew World, you have to create trade routes, build industries and develop\nthe economy of the colonies.\nOf course, in Free Play mode, you can mix both of those in any way you\nwant, letting you create your own unique and exciting story.\nFor the first time in the acclaimed Port Royale series, you are not alone\nin the beautiful and seemingly so peaceful seas of the Caribbean.\nThe Multiplayer mode allows up to 4 players to play through LAN or over\nthe Internet. Develop a successful trading company, lead your ships in\nbeautiful 3D naval battles and force your opponents to their knees!\n\nInstructions:\n\n- Burn or mount the image\n- Install the game\n- Copy the crack\n- Enjoy\n\nThis release is intended as an update, it just wasn't worth the trouble to make a DOX for the size of it.\nThis release includes patch 1.3.1 5 DLCs and 3 Skins\n\n- Pirate\n- Ivory\n- Adventure\n- Party Time\n- New Adventures\n- Dawn of Pirates\n- Harbour Master\n- Ghost Ship\n\nMany thanks to all our supporters -- you know who you are.\n\n[ GRUPPO ]\n\nEstablished in 1999, we are possibly the oldest Italian-based\nrelease group still in activity.
