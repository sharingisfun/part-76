Lech Majewski brings to life Pieter Bruegel's masterpiece The Way to Calvary, the story of the crucifixion, setting it in 16th century Flanders under brutal Spanish occupation. Rutger Hauer plays the artist, Michael York his patron, and Charlotte Rampling the Virgin Mary. As epic events unfold, bawdy country living continues unabated: couples entwine, musicians play wind instruments, soldiers torment their enemies mercilessly, and children scurry about. Using sophisticated computer technology, the filmmaker creates a brilliantly complex and fascinating multi-layered dreamscape that melds iconic moments in art, history, and religion with the quotidian lives of ordinary people. -- (C) Kino Lorber\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Procession_to_Calvary_(Bruegel)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Procession_to_Calvary_(Bruegel)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc8e8ad0419a79df2f0028a31af5e561d07b6fa5","amp;dn":"The+Mill+and+The+Cross+2011+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc8e8ad0419a79df2f0028a31af5e561d07b6fa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,142,138,208,65,154,121,223,47,0,40,163,26,245,229,97,208,123,111,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
