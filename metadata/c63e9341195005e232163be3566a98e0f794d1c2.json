Ed got the story from Wendell Potter (a News Analyst with the Center for Public Integrity, a Contributing Writer for the Huffington Post, and the author of Deadly Spin).\n\nNext up, big business done right: Steven Greenhouse (New York Times labor journalist) described how Costco is looking out for middle class workers.\n\nHostess executives want more money, even as 18,000 workers lose their jobs. Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) had the details.\n\nAnd in the BIG Finish, Tara Dowdell (Democratic Strategist and Former Apprentice Contestant) knocked down Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX)'s latest conspiracy theory about Obama and Libya.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c63e9341195005e232163be3566a98e0f794d1c2","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+11-29-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c63e9341195005e232163be3566a98e0f794d1c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,62,147,65,25,80,5,226,50,22,59,227,86,106,152,224,247,148,209,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
