Now recovering from his injuries but tortured by nightmares he tries to stay on the periphery and persuade Rosie (Ruth Negga) to come home from London. When John Boy pays off a large debt, Darren yet again finds himself trapped and back under John Boy's control.\n\nStill spooked by the death of his brother Hughie, John Boy's drug habit is making him increasingly paranoid and erratic. Nidge, now John Boy's second in command and principle enforcer, is trying to juggle an always tricky personal and professional life. Trish is about to have a baby and Nidge must try to maintain peace as John Boy becomes progressively volatile. When a consignment of drugs is impounded by customs, it sparks a war with a rival gang leader Fran. As the crisis escalates, John Boy becomes unpredictable and dangerous; loyal to no-one including members of his own gang.\n\n\nIN THIS EPISODE\nSilver-tongued Nidge sets out to persuade Dano that he had nothing to do with \nhis fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappearance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but a scapegoat will have to be found, someone will\nhave to pay the price. Once more, Nidge turns to ever faithful Darren for help.\n\nMeanwhile Siobhan struggles to cope with recent traumatic events and Tommy - \ncompromised by his affair with Debbie - doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help by desperately persuading\nher to keep her mouth shut.\n\nWritten by Stuart Carolan.\n\n\nCAST\nRobert Sheehan     ...

Love/Hate is the flagship content of IT and smurfty has asked that i not flip it to public trackers immediately.\n\nZamboni1, i must say i really don't understand why you seem to prefer the rips of the crappy DVDs with the hundreds of blended frames in each episode. I tried to explain why the PDTV are better and it seems to have scared you off.
