Four immortal brothers and sisters, four archons, leaping through time, consumed in an epic struggle to influence and shape the history of Western civilization. From MosesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ challenge to the Pharaoh to the origin of the Grail myth; from the PopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extermination of the Cathars to NostradamusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ travels in Italy; from the Spanish Armada and the Great Fire of London to NapoleonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conquest of Egypt; and finally to the Angel of Mons appearing over the trenches of World War I: a secret occult history of the world.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nPS: If you want to request a comic, please make a post here: https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=51\nand add as title something like [scanlation] title_of_comic.\nIt makes it easier for me to keep track of requests :P\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNote:\n\nIf you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).\nThen, you can use &quot;.cbr files and open them with ComicRack.\nIt's easy to use, and has a great quality!\n\nHope you enjoy!\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor other comics, you can check my release thread:      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&lt;/a&gt;\nHere the most recent versions of the torrents will be referenced.
