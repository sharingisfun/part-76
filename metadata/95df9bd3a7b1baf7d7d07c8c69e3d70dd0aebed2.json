Used a different software this time, came out clean. Also the quality is a bit lower than I'd like, not sure if it's the codec, probably the rain causing too many changes on screen. In the future I'll use a higher bitrate for races with a lot of rain.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95df9bd3a7b1baf7d7d07c8c69e3d70dd0aebed2","amp;dn":"%5BRace-Vids%5D+F1+-+2012+-+Brazil+-+Race+%28US+Broadcast%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95df9bd3a7b1baf7d7d07c8c69e3d70dd0aebed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,223,155,211,167,177,186,247,215,208,124,140,105,227,215,13,208,174,190,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
