Metallurgical Engineering has played a crucial role in the development of human civilization beginning with bronze-age some 3000 years ago when tools and weapons were mostly produced from the metals and alloys. This science has matured over millennia and still plays crucial role by supplying materials having suitable properties.\n\nTitle: Recent Researches in Metallurgical Engineering - From Extraction to Forming\nAuthor: Mohammad Nusheh, Horacio Garza Ahuett, Alejandro Arrambide\nPublisher: InTech\nYear: 2012\nFormat: PDF\n\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9522402967f5920fb5b0d79b39470d062bb84eda","amp;dn":"Recent+Researches+in+Metallurgical+Engineering-2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9522402967f5920fb5b0d79b39470d062bb84eda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,34,64,41,103,245,146,15,181,176,215,155,57,71,13,6,43,184,78,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
