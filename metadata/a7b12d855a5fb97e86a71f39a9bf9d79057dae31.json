Each morning, the inhabitants of that world are woken up and pulled to their jobs by the sunlight, as if by a magnetic force. Our protagonist works in a factory making electric light bulbs, but has larger ambitions of his own. The setting of the film is a classic Buenos Aires, revisited from a fantastic point of view. The film uses a collage of styles, combining art deco, tango, surrealism, and neorealism. This mix of influences is directly linked with the history of Buenos Aires: the city and its population themselves are a mix of different cultures.\n\n\nNo languages or subs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7b12d855a5fb97e86a71f39a9bf9d79057dae31","amp;dn":"Luminaris+2011+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7b12d855a5fb97e86a71f39a9bf9d79057dae31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,177,45,133,90,95,185,126,134,167,31,57,169,191,157,121,5,125,174,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
