Is it steel,\nKevlar, carbon nanotubes, or something entirely new? NOVA\nkicks off the four-part series &quot;Making Stuff&quot; with a quest\nfor the world's strongest substances. Host David Pogue takes\na look at what defines strength, examining everything from\nsteel cables to mollusk shells to a toucan's beak. Pogue\ntravels from the deck of a U.S. naval aircraft carrier to a\ndemolition derby to the country's top research labs to check\nin with experts who are re-engineering what nature has given\nus to create the next generation of strong stuff.\n\nMaking Stuff: Smaller\n\nHow small can we go? Could we one day have robots taking\n&quot;fantastic voyages&quot; in our bodies to kill rogue cells? The\ntriumphs of tiny are seen all around us in the Information\nAge: transistors, microchips, laptops, cell phones.\nNow, David Pogue takes NOVA viewers to an even smaller world\nin &quot;Making Stuff: Smaller,&quot; examining the latest in high-powered\nnano-circuits and micro-robots that may one day hold the key\nto saving lives.\n\nMaking Stuff: Cleaner\n\nCan innovations in materials science help clean up our\nworld? In &quot;Making Stuff: Cleaner,&quot; David Pogue explores the\nrapidly developing science and business of clean energy and\nexamines alternative ways to generate it, store it, and\ndistribute it. Is hydrogen the way to go? What about lithium\nbatteries? Does this solve an energy problem or create a new\ndependency? Pogue investigates the latest developments in\nbio-based fuels and in harnessing solar energy for our cars,\nhomes, and industry in a program full of the stuff of a\nsustainable future.\n\nMaking Stuff: Smarter\n\n&quot;Making Stuff: Smarter&quot; looks at materials that respond to\ntheir environments and even learn, such as an airplane wing\nthat changes shape as it flies. Scientists are turning to\nnature in developing such &quot;smart&quot; stuff. Sharkskin, for\ninstance, has inspired a substance that, when sprayed in\nhospitals, could eliminate antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nDavid Pogue visits a scientist who has even created a material\nthat can render objects invisible. &quot;Smarter&quot; concludes with a\nvision of the ultimate in &quot;life-like&quot; stuff: programmable matter\nthat could create a duplicate of a human being.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:111cef6faf9d643bccb0d1f658781d6112882fa4","amp;dn":"NOVA.Making.Stuff.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-CtrlHD+%5BPublicHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"111cef6faf9d643bccb0d1f658781d6112882fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,28,239,111,175,157,100,59,204,176,209,246,88,120,29,97,18,136,47,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
