Our aim is to create a light Linux distribution which is simple, Up to date, Fast, User friendly and which follows the K.I.S.S principle. This means for our users, They still have a rolling release but not so fast as Arch-Linux might be. AUR is still usable and you have all features you know from Arch Linux. This way we provide a stable system which is still up to date.\n\nManjaro 0.8.2 is the most polished, feature-rich, and accessible release yet. Just a few of the new features provided includes support for Steam gaming, automatic desktop notifications for new system updates, and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ developed exclusively for Manjaro Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a user-friendly graphical interface to easily manage and maintain the system. Experienced users can also take advantage of support for new features, including the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI), B-Tree File System (btrfs), and Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) storage system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4d1cf2323b12336e176686d4272f5f707e79b88","amp;dn":"Manjaro+Linux+0.8.2+KDE+%2832-bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4d1cf2323b12336e176686d4272f5f707e79b88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,209,207,35,35,177,35,54,225,118,104,109,66,114,245,247,7,231,155,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
