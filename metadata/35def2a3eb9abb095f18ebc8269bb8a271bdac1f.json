You can enable encryption for your wireless network, but it does not guarantee that your password will not be compromised, even if you are using a WPA2 security.

For these purposes you can use the &quot;Subnet Monitoring&quot; tool from the MyLanViewer. It will show who is connected to your Wi-Fi router.\n\nSystem requirements:\n\nWindows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7, 2008, 8. 32-bit or 64-bit.
