For Stephen Travers, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new bass player, it was an unusual experience but he wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too worried.\n\nHowever, as his band mates were lined up beside their vehicle Stephen noticed that the atmosphere had suddenly changedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ something more sinister was happening. In a flash their lives were dramatically altered when a bomb that was being placed in the back of their van suddenly exploded prematurely.\n\nThe events of that night would never leave Stephen Travers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ being hurled into the air by the explosion, listening to the cries of his friends as they were mercilessly gunned down and the steps of the gunmen getting closer as they approached to finish him offÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nWhat is it like to survive such an atrocity? To live when all around you others died?\n\nIn The Miami Showband Massacre, Stephen Travers remembers the highs of being in the most successful showband of the 1970s and how it all ended in a terrifying moment of death and destruction. But he also looks for answers as to why his friends Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tony Geraghty, Fran OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Toole and Brian McCoy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were killed. Who ordered the ambush?\n\nWhat drove them to such an act? Stephen wants to understand, but will he find the answers when he meets the men responsible for the massacre face to face?
