Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) explained why.\n\nUnemployment hits a 4-year low, but Republican obstruction is keeping the country from creating even more jobs. Ed brought you the latest numbers and ask economist David Cay Johnston why now is the time to focus on job creation.\n\nRepublicans in Michigan are ramming through anti-union legislation and hurt middle class Americans in the process and the people of Michigan are outraged. Ed talked to MayorVirg Bernero, (D) Lansing, Michigan, about that.\n\nThe push to pass the violence against women act is on, but Fox News just doesn't get it. Ed had the details.\n\nAnd in the Big Finish, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it will hear two landmark cases on same-sex marriage.
