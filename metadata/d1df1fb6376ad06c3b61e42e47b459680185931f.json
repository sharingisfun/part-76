In the 1970s, Seo In Ha and Kim Yoon Hee, an art student and a shy beauty, met and fell in love with each other during college; but unfortunately their love was fated to never be.\n\nNow in the present 21st century Korea, Seo In Ha's son, Seo Joon (a liberal photographer) meets the daughter of Kim Yoon Hee, Jung Ha Na, a cheerful and energetic girl whose personality is different from her mother's. At first, they both found each other to be a nuisance and troublesome. Gradually, their feelings develop for one another. In Ha had never quite gotten over his love for Yoon Hee, despite marrying one of her best friends, Hye Jung. He is over the moon when he sees Yoon Hee on the streets and the two reconcile and make up for time lost. Little do they know that their children are dating each other, and the greater shock comes when they announce their marriage to their children...\n\n\nEpisode 1:\n\nIn-Ha (Jang Keun-Suk) is a university student majoring in art. In-Ha and his friends Dong-Wook (Kim Shi-Hoo), a medical student, and Chang-Mo (Seo In-Guk), a law student, are popular at school, especially with women. In-Ha, Dong-Wook and Chang-Mo also enjoy playing the guitar and singing together.\nOne day, In-Ha passes female student Yoon-Hee (Yoona) on campus. It takes no more than 3 seconds for In-Ha to fall in love with Yoon-Hee. He later sees Yoon-Hee sitting on a bench, while painting. In-Ha begins to paint her portrait, but the next moment she is gone. In-Ha runs out to find her and, in his excitement, bumps into Yoon-Hee. Yoon-Hee drops what she is holding. In-Ha helps to pick her stuff up, but doesn't say anything to her. After she leaves, In-Ha discovers a small notebook that she left behind. The notebook is her diary. At night, In-Ha opens up the diary and reads a page. He learns that Yoon-Hee's parents died and she loves the American film &quot;Love Story.&quot; He then closes shut the diary. The next day, In-Ha waits for her outside a campus building to return her diary. When he turns around and is about leave, Yoon-Hee appears and asks In-Ha if he has seen her notebook. In-Ha doesn't speak up in time and misses returning her diary. In-Ha then reads more from her diary, this time from front to back multiple times.\nOn a rainy day, In-Ha sees Yoon-Hee standing in front of building without an umbrella. In-Ha offers to walk her with his umbrella. As they walk together they feel a bond. A date is set to meet the following Sunday to watch the movie &quot;Love Story&quot;.\n\nLater, Dong-Wook takes In-Ha and Chang-Mo to a get-together at a restaurant. Dong-Wook asks In-Ha and Chang-Mo to help him get closer to Yoon-Hee. Dong-Wook met Yoon-Hee the day before and also fell in love with her. She reminds him of his late mother. Because of this, Dong-Wook had asked his friend Hye-Jung (Son Eun-Seo) to bring Yoon-Hee to the get-together at the restaurant...\n_____________________________________________\n\nMP4 format with hardcoded English subtitles.\n\nVideo...: H.264/AVC Video\nAudio...: 192 kbps, 2 Channel (AAC)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1df1fb6376ad06c3b61e42e47b459680185931f","amp;dn":"%5Byoushikibi%5D+%EC%82%AC%EB%9E%91%EB%B9%84+%28Love+Rain%29+-+01+%281280x720+h264+AAC%29+%5B0a25471d%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1df1fb6376ad06c3b61e42e47b459680185931f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,223,31,182,55,106,208,108,59,97,228,46,71,180,89,104,1,133,147,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
