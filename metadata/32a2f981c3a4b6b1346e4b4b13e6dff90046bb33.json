Myths are proved true, probable, possible, improbable or busted. Often after the real-world practical tests have proved or debunked a Myth, the team will take the experiment to the extreme, many times using more modern technology than the myth could have used or upping the black powder for impressive explosions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32a2f981c3a4b6b1346e4b4b13e6dff90046bb33","amp;dn":"MythBusters.S12E07.Hypermiling.-.Crash.Cushions.720p.HDTV.x264-K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32a2f981c3a4b6b1346e4b4b13e6dff90046bb33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,162,249,129,195,164,182,177,52,110,75,75,19,230,223,249,0,70,187,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
