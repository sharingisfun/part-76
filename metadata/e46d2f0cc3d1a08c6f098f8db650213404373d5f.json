It offers some suggestions why sending young children away to board is a particularly British habit, and what may have caused their remarkable attitude to children.\n\n\nThe book proposes that children who board are compelled to 'survive' psychologically - sometimes to their great cost. It argues that in order to cope with their loss of family and to adapt to their school environment, children unconsciously construct a 'Strategic Survival Personality', and that such a personality structure invariably becomes counter-productive in adult life. The book also offers suggestions for reversing the effects of 'boarding school survival' by means of the development of self- awareness and through psychotherapeutic help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e46d2f0cc3d1a08c6f098f8db650213404373d5f","amp;dn":"The+Making+of+Them","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e46d2f0cc3d1a08c6f098f8db650213404373d5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,109,47,12,195,209,160,140,111,9,143,141,182,80,33,52,4,55,61,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
