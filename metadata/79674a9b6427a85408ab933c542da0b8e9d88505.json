Jack Tripper met Vicky Bradford and fell in love with her at first sight. In the last episode he proposed marriage but due to her parents' divorce, she doesn't believe or want, but is willing to live with him. So, they move into the apartment above Jack's restaurant. Now Vicky's father who doesn't approve of Jack and even more doesn't approve of their living arrangement buys Jack's restaurant and thus becomes the new owner and is constantly dropping in to disrupt their relationship. Thus Three's a Crowd\n\nKeep watching i will be doing a release of The Ropers shortly as well\n\nThanks\nZ0DiAC'99","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79674a9b6427a85408ab933c542da0b8e9d88505","amp;dn":"Threes+A+Crowd+-+Z0DiAC%2799","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79674a9b6427a85408ab933c542da0b8e9d88505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,103,74,155,100,39,168,84,8,171,147,60,84,45,160,184,233,216,133,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
