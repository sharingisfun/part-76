This true story follows the tumultuous relationship between two men who became lovers and ultimately ruthless bank robbers in a notoriously famous footnote in the annals of Argentinian crime history. Nene, Angel and Cuervo are bank robbers who flee from Argentina across the border to Uruguay after a large-scale hold-up that turns bloody. Angel is hurt and the three must lay low until Angel recovers. Nene and Angel are known to everyone they know as &quot;the twins&quot; because of their resemblance, but the two are not brothers at all - they are involved in a steamy homosexual relationship. To get back to Argentina, the group must first wait for Fontana, the brains behind the robbery, to arrange for passports. Anxious from hiding, Cuervo decides to break curfew and go party. After Nene and Angel also decide to take off, Nene meets a prostitute named Giselle and Angel ends up getting in a fight...\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nVideo                        : DVD-9\nAudio                        : Spanish (2.0 Dolby Stereo)\nSubtitles                    : Bulgarian\nFormat                       : MPEG Video\nWidth                        : 720 pixels\nHeight                       : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio  : 16:9\nFrame rate                   : 25.000 fps\nStandard                     : PAL\nMenu                         : Yes\nCredits                      : Yes\nRuntime:                     : 120 min\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f715f1a5a143ec1bc152b493642bc9fd0dfaccdf","amp;dn":"Plata+quemada+%2F+Burnt+Money+%282000%29+%28DVD9-Sub.BG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f715f1a5a143ec1bc152b493642bc9fd0dfaccdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,21,241,165,161,67,236,27,193,82,180,147,100,43,201,253,13,250,204,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
