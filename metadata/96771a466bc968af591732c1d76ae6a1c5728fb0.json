With chapters by leading research groups, it      \n  features current information on the structural and functional roles of     \n  intrinsic disorders in viral proteomes. It systematically addresses the    \n  measles, HIV, influenza, potato virus, forest virus, bovine virus,         \n  hepatitis, and rotavirus as well as viral genomics. After analyzing the    \n  unique features of each class of viral proteins, future directions for     \n  research and disease management are presented.                             \n\n  +-[ ALEXANDRIA ]----------------------------------------------------------+\n  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :\n  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :\n  : of the ancient world.
