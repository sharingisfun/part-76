TDD can be done in every modern programming environment, and for desktop, mobile, or web apps. In this course, Simon Allardice teaches you exactly how to get started with TDD: what makes a good test, why we're more interested in failure than success, and how to measure and repeatedly run tests.\n\nThe course explores the jargon of TDDÃ¢â‚¬â€test suites, test harness, mock and stub objects, and moreÃ¢â‚¬â€and covers how TDD is used in the most common programming languages and environments. Plus learn to create, run, and manage the tests and move to a test-first mindset.\nTopics include:\n\n* What is test-driven development?\n* Using unit testing frameworks\n* Creating tests\n* Using assertions\n* Creating multiple test methods\n* Naming unit tests and test methods\n* Testing return values\n* Setting up and tearing down\n* Introducing mock objects\n* Measuring code coverage\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction - 3m 14s\n* Welcome - 1m 23s\n* What you need to know - 1m 51s\n\n1.
