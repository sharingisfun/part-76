Over the course of 15 years and 64 issues of his much-loved, self published 'zine KING-CAT Comics and Stories, John has chronicled his life and the world around him with honesty, grace, and intelligence.\n&quot;Diary&quot; compiles stories from a decade's worth of KING-CAT on the subject of his years spent as a mosquito exterminator. From early, scratchy punk drawings to later, more refined work (as well as 30 brand-new pages created specifically for this edition...), John examines his time on the job, and how it affected his life, his health, and his view of the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f37112f5fb406d6993f063cd95df8b32c05ad961","amp;dn":"John+Porcellino%3A+Diary+of+a+Mosquito+Abatement+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f37112f5fb406d6993f063cd95df8b32c05ad961","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,113,18,245,251,64,109,105,147,240,99,205,149,223,139,50,192,90,217,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
