This may actually be the simplest\nedition of the shooter franchise that developer\nPivotal Games has produced, with gameplay so\nout of date that it might as well be wearing a\nplaid flannel shirt and listening to Alice in\nChains. But even though the action is a good\ndecade behind the times, the game's rapid-fire\npace blurs the fact that you're shooting the\nsame bad guys over and over again. Cooperative\nplay is a highlight and earns the game some\napplause all by itself given how this shooter\nfeature is so often asked for and so rarely\ndelivered. This mindless shooter is ideal for\nthose moments when you want to switch off the\nsynapses, though some awkward control issues\noccasionally get in the way.\n\nI N F O\nThe game was ripped using a Maximus AVR board\nwith PSGroove.\nBackup was made with Backup Manager 2.\n\nI N S T A L L   N O T E S\nUnrar files and copy BLES00182 dir to\nexternal harddrive or use the Ps3 FTP server.\nFiles must be placed in the GAMEZ folder.\n\nPEMA IS LOOKING FOR:\n200 Mbit+ Affil sites\n\nReach us at pema [a] hush.ai\n\n!nKO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ee94d2de9b8f854b3e5b63cb73efe347f167166","amp;dn":"Conflict.Denied.Ops.EUR.JB.PS3-PEMA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ee94d2de9b8f854b3e5b63cb73efe347f167166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,233,77,45,233,184,248,84,179,229,182,60,183,62,254,52,127,22,113,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
