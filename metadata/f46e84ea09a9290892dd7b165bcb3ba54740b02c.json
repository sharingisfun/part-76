But then Dorothy goes and gets herself pregnant. It's his child, too, of course; but this ruins everything. Her moralistic father will disown her and will certainly never accept him. It seems he's trapped.  He doesn't have to worry. As his mother says, when he turns his mind to something, he does it. Unknown to her, his thoughts have turned to murder.\n          \n\nStars: Robert Wagner and Virginia Leith\n\nColor: Color\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.55 : 1 (widescreem)\n\nPortuguese subtitle .srt\n\nSample\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042579/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042579/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f46e84ea09a9290892dd7b165bcb3ba54740b02c","amp;dn":"A+Kiss+Before+Dying+-+1956","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f46e84ea09a9290892dd7b165bcb3ba54740b02c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,110,132,234,9,169,41,8,146,221,123,22,91,203,59,165,71,64,176,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
