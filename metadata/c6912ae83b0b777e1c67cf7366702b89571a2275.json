Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nOne of the very, very few books of Marian devotion I can stomach. It's a great book. Really great. And Caryll Houselander was a wonderfully odd personality. Would you believe I own a small handicraft she made? I do. Not that that has anything to do with this upload ...\n\n\ndescription:\n\nFirst published over half a century ago, Caryll Houselander's The Reed of God is a spiritual classic that deserves to be rediscovered by a whole new generation of readers. Houselander's beautiful and profound mediation depicts the intimately human side of Mary, Mother of God, as an empty reed waiting for God's music to be played through her. She shares her insightful and beautiful vision of Mary on earth, Mary among us, Mary as a confused but trusting teenager whose holiness flowered with her eternal &quot;Yes.&quot;\n\nReview\n\n&quot;This wonderful book gives us a privileged peek into the soul of a holy woman as she engages beautiful biblical texts in prayer. In ways witty and winsome, Houselander teaches us to unite our will with God's will, as the Blessed Virgin Mary did.&quot; --Scott Hahn, author of Hail, Holy Queen\n\nAbout the Author\n\nCaryll Houselander (1901-1954) was a lay English artist who became one of the most popular Catholic spiritual writers of modern times. She shared a unique and mystical vision of Christianity and Catholic teachings through her writing. In 1944, The Reed of God, a collection of profound and lyrical essays about Mary, established Houselander as a respected modern spiritual writer in the tradition of Julian of Norwich, Catherine of Siena and Teresa of Avila.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6912ae83b0b777e1c67cf7366702b89571a2275","amp;dn":"Caryll+Houselander+-+The+Reed+of+God+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6912ae83b0b777e1c67cf7366702b89571a2275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,145,42,232,59,11,119,126,28,103,207,115,102,112,43,137,87,26,34,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
