An entertaining mix of rootsy originals and inspired covers, including Mississippi bluesman J.B. Lenoir's &quot;I Want To Go&quot; and hill country legend R.L. Burnside's &quot;Goin' Down South,&quot; the album is an intricate mix of Delta blues, Southern-fried country funk, and roots-rock. Gina Leigh is a gifted vocalist, belting out the bluesier numbers with passion and finesse while Gray's gruffer vocals are better suited for the more subdued and countryish material.
