All these &quot;ideas worth spreading&quot; have been downloaded directly from the TED website in 480p with hardcoded English subtitles, except for three of the videos which were YouTube uploads and were therefore downloaded at the best possible quality. To provide easy import into iTunes as well as convenient playback on iPods and other such mobile devices, the videos have been encoded with the &quot;iPhone &amp; iPod Touch&quot; preset using the Handbrake application. These videos have been originally provided freely to the public, and now may hopefully be shared and spread even better.
