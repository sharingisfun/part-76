Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) and Michael Steele (former Chairman of the Republican National Committee and MSNBC Analyst), joined Ed to look at the Republican chaos that plays right into the hands of Democrats.\n\nThen, Sen. Bernie Sanders stands up for the middle class, while Republican leaders try to hold the line for millionaires. Ruth Conniff (Political Editor of The Progressive Magazine), and E.J. Dionne (Senior Fellow at The Brookings Institution and Washington Post columnist), joined Ed for that discussion.\n\nPresident Obama and the Democrats focused on whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really at stake in the fiscal fight, they visited a section of Staten island still reeling from Hurricane Sandy. Ed explained what it all means for American cities.\n\nSen. John McCain demands answers on Benghazi, and then skips a briefing on the attack that left four Americans dead. Richard Wolffe (Executive Editor, MSNBC.com, MSNBC Political Analyst), broke down another bizarre day for McCain.\n\nA Denny's franchise owner delivered a grand slam to workers over the president's health care law. Ed had the details.\n\nAnd in the Big Finish, outrage over President Obama's re-election hits a whole new level as radical Republicans bring up impeachment. Seriously. Michael Tomasky (Special Correspondent, The Daily Beast), joined Ed for reaction and analysis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c787fb3f7bb14f9f70f758f4f868494a51da689","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+11-15-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c787fb3f7bb14f9f70f758f4f868494a51da689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,120,127,179,247,187,20,249,247,15,117,143,79,134,132,148,165,29,166,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
