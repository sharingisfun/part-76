Some travelled from as far afield as Spain and Monaco. They heard first-hand harrowing allegations of abuse, tales of families Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtorn apartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and of one tragic case that ended with the death of a Stafford mother.\n\nThe event was organised by Stafford family rights campaigner Jane Webb.\nOn stage she paid tribute to local mum Willow Simpson who hanged herself at St GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hospital in 2007 after learning her son would be adopted without her consent.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done this because there is nothing being done to support these parents and to keep families together,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she told the Post. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The main thing we want is to get juries into family courts, to stop forced adoptions and for the courts to stop gagging parents so they can speak out about injustice.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOne mum who took to the stage during the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœopen mikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ session of the conference spoke of her battle to win back her son who she claimed was abused in care. While being filmed for the event she said: \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I will fight, fight, fight and I am not giving up, I will never give up. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s me and his family that love him, not strangers in care.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSpeaker Ian Josephs, who runs a language school in Monaco, is fighting for changes in the law. During the 1960s the campaigning father of seven re-united many parents with children who had been taken into care, while he was a councillor.\n\nNow he wants juries, rather than a judge, to rule on family court proceedings and for the lifting of Ã¢â‚¬ËœgaggingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ orders on parents who are going through the court system so they can speak out about their experiences.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The family courts system is a disgrace,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said.\n\nHe also criticised social services for removing babies from mothers due to the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrisk of emotional harmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nOrganiser Jane Webb said the controversial event had been an Ã¢â‚¬Ëœamazing successÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.&quot;\n\n--\n\nMain points in this recording:\n\nBrian Gerrish (Introduction)\nIan Josephs (Forced Adoptions)\nJack Frost (Gulag of the Family Courts)\nKevin Annett, AKA Eagle Strong Voice (Canadian Indian Holocaust)\nRobert Green (Hollie Greig)\nOpen Mic somewhere in the middle there, and some live music\n\n\n\nFile Information:\n\nDate Captured: Saturday 10 April 2010\nLocation: Stafford Rangers FC Pavilion, Stafford, Staffordshire, England\nHardware: JVC MiniDV model: GR-D350, single camera\nCapture Format: Digital Video (DV) standard definition 4:3 frame\nTransfer Format: RAW over Firewire\n\nCompression: \nVideo: DivX 5.0 3072kbps CBR 25.00fps@640x480\nAudio: 44KHz 16-Bit Stereo MP3@192kbps\nSoftware: Nero 6.6.1.4 Ultra Edition\nTotal Run Time: 4H52M17S (292M17S)\nArchive Size: 6.53GB (7,019,202,560 Bytes)\n\nCredits:\n\nVT Operator: James-Ross Moore\nVT Sound: James-Ross Moore\nPA Sound: Stafford Rangers FC\nLighting: Sol\nDirector: Brian Gerrish\nLocation: Jane Webb\nEvent Organisers: Jane Webb, Penny Pullen\nCatering: Jane Webb, Penny Pullen &amp; Friends\nMusic: Barbara Richards\nProducers (Event): UKColumn\nProducer (VT): James-Ross Moore\n\nCOPYRIGHT INFORMATION:\n\nThis recording is made available on the understanding that if the intention is to redistribute, this document is included in intact form with ALL copies.
