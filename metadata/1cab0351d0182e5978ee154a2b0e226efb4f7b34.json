Epic Chef, the online spinoff series of the YouTube cooking show Epic Meal Time that pits professional chefs against one another, debuted today.\nBecause todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenge featured portion-challenged, double deep-fried, beer-battered breakfast items, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safe to expect a meal of even more epic proportions in the upcoming holiday special. In this exclusive clip, chef Shawn Dobbin and Gavin Mills are harassed by host Harley Morenstein and guest judges Kevin Pereira and Charles Phoenix for not prepping the food appropriately and for reading instructions off ingredient boxes. What happened to their holiday cheer?\nAnd you thought Anthony Bourdain was uninhibited and Paula Deen was butter-happy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cab0351d0182e5978ee154a2b0e226efb4f7b34","amp;dn":"Epic+Chef+Episode+2+%28Epic+Meal+Time%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cab0351d0182e5978ee154a2b0e226efb4f7b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,171,3,81,208,24,46,89,120,238,21,74,43,14,34,110,251,79,123,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
