It is relatively new, the design having been presented to the public by the Government of India on 15 July 2010,[1] following its selection through an open competition among Indian residents. Before its adoption, the most commonly used symbols for the rupee were Rs, Re or, if the text was in an Indian language, an appropriate abbreviation in that language. The new sign relates to only the Indian currency; other countries that use a rupee, such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal, still use the generic U+20A8 Ã¢â€šÂ¨ rupee sign character.\n\nThe design resembles both the Devanagari letter &quot;Ã Â¤Â°&quot; (ra) and the Latin capital letter &quot;R&quot;, with a double horizontal line at the top.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68d48e5eb139c995027ae396ff776f0b936c0b6","amp;dn":"Indian+Rupees+Symbol+Rs.+By+Rin2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68d48e5eb139c995027ae396ff776f0b936c0b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,141,72,229,235,19,156,153,80,39,174,57,111,247,118,240,185,54,192,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
