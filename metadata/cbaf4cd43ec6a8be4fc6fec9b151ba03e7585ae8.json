The lack of advertising before release and realism in the game are commonly cited as reasons why this game was outshone by its competitors in the stealth genre and sold poorly.\n\nThis game is best played on PC, because the graphics are far better on PC than PS2.\nUse the PCSX2 v 1.0 which I have included, &amp; use my setup config to begin the game (Very easy) I've been playing this on 2 fairly standard rigs with core 2 duo &amp; half reasonable graphics cards, didn't get a single skip in frame rate. On PC, NTSC or PAL doesn't matter. Everything needed to play this game is included.\n\n\nFor PC, I recommend:\n\nCore 2 Duo 2.4 &amp; above.\nWindows XP / VISTA / 7\nGraphics card GeForce GT 8800, or ATI 6 series &amp; above.\n4 Gig of RAM\n\n\nFor PS2, I recommend:\n\nNeed a modded PS2 console; burn at very slow speed to compensate for \nthe weak PS2 laser.\n\n                                ENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbaf4cd43ec6a8be4fc6fec9b151ba03e7585ae8","amp;dn":"Spy+Fiction+%2B+PCSX2+v+1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbaf4cd43ec6a8be4fc6fec9b151ba03e7585ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,175,76,212,62,198,168,190,79,198,254,201,177,81,186,3,231,88,90,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
