The main characters of the story must uncover the supernatural forces behind these crimes.\n\nA good deal of publicity was generated from the developer's rejection of conventional game genre labeling for the title; Quantic Dream prefers to brand it as the first truly &quot;interactive film&quot; rather than an adventure or third-person action title.[citation needed] This game features a large amount of motion captured animation as well as branching story lines, split screen cameras and an interface designed to be intuitive and realistic. Event triggers in the game are also mainly time-based, as opposed to the more common player-initiated progression found in most games.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:517b42683678206910bd2a8640f048313f1f62cc","amp;dn":"Fahrenheit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"517b42683678206910bd2a8640f048313f1f62cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,123,66,104,54,120,32,105,16,189,42,134,64,240,72,49,63,31,98,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
