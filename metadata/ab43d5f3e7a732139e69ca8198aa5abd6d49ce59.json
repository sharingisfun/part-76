If not, here is the article:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/729197/g4-marks-the-end-of-aots-and-x-play-with-two-month-farewells/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/729197/g4-marks-the-end-of-aots-and-x-play-with-two-month-farewells/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt sucks that these 2 awesome shows are ending. But at least we will have the memories or will we? I believe that all of the great footage from AOTS &amp; X-Play that is available at G4tv.com, on Youtube, &amp; wherever else will probably be taken away when the new network comes. So we will lose all of that great footage unless we do something. That is why I am hoping to archive AOTS, X-Play, &amp; G4 with this: The G4 Lives Project. What I am hoping to do is to keep G4's Legacy alive just like those who did the same with TechTV before me. So here is the 1st torrent for this project.\n\n\n\nSome Important Notes:\n\n\n1. I am going to post AOTS &amp; X-Play in packs. Either by segment, host, etc.\n\n\n2. The quality of the videos will vary. I am getting the best version for each vid (in HD when available).\n\n\n3. The sizes of the torrents for this project will vary as well. Some will be small &amp; others will be BIG!\n\n\n4. I am going to need help on this project. I can NOT do this all on my own. There are thousands &amp; thousands of videos to get from G4tv.com &amp; elsewhere for AOTS, X-Play, &amp; G4. So I am looking for volunteers to help me. If you are interested, let me know in the comments. So then we can coordinate about what you can do. Please guys I need help if this project is going to be successful. So please help out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab43d5f3e7a732139e69ca8198aa5abd6d49ce59","amp;dn":"The+G4+Lives+Project+presents+AOTS%3A+As+Seen+on+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab43d5f3e7a732139e69ca8198aa5abd6d49ce59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,67,213,243,231,167,50,19,158,105,202,129,152,170,90,189,109,73,206,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
