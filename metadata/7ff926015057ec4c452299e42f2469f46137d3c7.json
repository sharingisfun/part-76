Camille (Brigitte Bardot) falls out of love with her husband Paul (Michel Piccoli) while he is rewriting the screenplay Odyssey by American producer Jeremiah Prokosch (Jack Palance). Just as the director of Prokosch's film, Fritz Lang, says that The Odyssey is the story of individuals confronting their situations in a real world, Le MÃƒÂ©pris itself is an examination of the position of the filmmaker in the commercial cinema. Godard himself was facing this situation in the production of Le MÃƒÂ©pris. Italian producer Carlo Ponti had given him the biggest budget of his career, and he found himself working with a star of Bardot's magnitude for the first time. ~ Louis Schwartz, Rovi\n\n\nLanguages: French / English / Italian / German\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ff926015057ec4c452299e42f2469f46137d3c7","amp;dn":"Le+Mepris+aka+Contempt+1963+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ff926015057ec4c452299e42f2469f46137d3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,249,38,1,80,87,236,76,69,34,153,228,47,36,105,244,97,55,211,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
