Two drifters, Len and Coby, on the run and being pursued by a sheriff, steal an army motorcycle and a side car equipped with a machine gun. This contraption is also desired by criminals Ward and El Supremo. The Army recovers the motorcycle and imprisons Coby. Len disguises himself as an army officer and helps Coby escape and they steal the motorcycle once again. The duo is pursued by the army along with a sheriff, Ward, El Supremo and a crazy spinster named Miss Peabody. This 'Trinity' rip-off stars look-a-likes Michael Coby (Antonio Cantafora) and Paul Smith.\n\nPicture quality is poor, but it's a classic.\n\nIf you like Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill you'll know what I mean.\n\nThe movie is missing a few seconds at the beginning.\n\nFirst showed in Sweden as &quot;SlÃƒÂ¥'n pÃƒÂ¥ kÃƒÂ¤ften&quot; in 1975.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f74a5c58ce59285cfb026582ca2326a30ed3eaf0","amp;dn":"Adventures+of+Coby+And+Len.1975.SWESUB.VHSRIP.XviD-VERMiN.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f74a5c58ce59285cfb026582ca2326a30ed3eaf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,74,92,88,206,89,40,92,251,2,101,130,202,35,38,163,14,211,234,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
