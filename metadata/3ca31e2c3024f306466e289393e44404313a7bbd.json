Music (though moving) would have taken away the grit to this story and given it a more artificial feel. It's amazing how much of the dialog and situations are straight from the book, and how perfectly spot on they are showing Recon Marine culture.\n\nI'm glad Rudy and Kocher got to play themselves. Though I only personally know Pappy out of these characters, it's obvious they are working as hard as they can (within Hollywood's tradition) to portray it as it happened. I hope they continue this series at least until the end of the invasion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ca31e2c3024f306466e289393e44404313a7bbd","amp;dn":"Generation+Kill+Complete+720p-pjones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ca31e2c3024f306466e289393e44404313a7bbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,163,30,44,48,36,243,6,70,110,40,147,147,228,68,4,49,58,123,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
