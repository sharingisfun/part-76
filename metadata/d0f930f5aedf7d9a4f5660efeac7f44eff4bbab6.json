The Firesign Theater were co-authors on the script but later disowned the film.\n\nThe soundtrack features the James Gang, Country Joe and the Fish, the New York Rock and Roll ensemble, Doug Kershaw, and White Lightenin' with incidental music by Jimmy Haskell. So far as I am aware, it was only released on LP and 8-track, not cassette or CD. The LP is a collector's item.\n\nThis torrent was made from a CD made from a cassette made from an LP on a low-end shelf system. The sound quality is listenable, but not great as the sound system's fidelity was mediocre at best. There are some pops and scratches as well as some tape hiss, and it seems to me that there's a slight high end cutoff on one or two tracks. \n\nThe tracks are:\n\nMain titles (Jimmy Haskell)\nLagune Salada (James Gang)\nWe're the Crackers (Country Joe and the Fish)\nWilliam Tell Overture (Jimmy Haskell\nAll I Need (Country Joe and the Fish)\nBallad of Job Cain (Doug Kershaw)\nCountry Fever (James Gang)\nThe Lonely Rider (Jimmy Haskell)\nMedley-Camino, Used Wagon Salesman (Jimmy Haskell, Firesign Theater)\nCamino Waltz (Jimmy Haskell)\nGravedigger (New York Rock and Roll Ensemble)\nShy Ann (White Lightenin')\nMatthew (Jimmy Haskell)\nEnd Titles (Jimmy Haskell)\n\nThis my first attempt at uploading a torrent.
