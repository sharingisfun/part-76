Extraordinary lives of ordinary people in search of love and happiness - that's the premise of &quot;C.R.A.Z.Y&quot;, a family drama unlike any other.  \n\nI de-muxed it and re-muxed it (whatever that is) and worked with the IFO files in the Video_ts file, and got it down to 595mb, as an .avi (it was 7.49gb!) And I did it all for you! I haven't even watched it yet, but the IMDB gave it a 7.9 out of 10. It must be a good movie. It is in French-Canadian, with English subtitles. \n\nIt failed, and only had an interview and some commercials for another movie, by the same guy. So I did it agaim with the Italian version, hard-coded, and with English subtitles, hard-coded. It is 1.38gb .mpeg4. I made it especially for the people on thepiratebay. That means you, oh pirate. Arrrr. Shiver me timbers, it worked!      \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7363a90204db18387944e7394d26c342b15ff9cb","amp;dn":"C.R.A.Z.Y._mpeg4.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7363a90204db18387944e7394d26c342b15ff9cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,99,169,2,4,219,24,56,121,68,231,57,77,38,195,66,177,95,249,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
