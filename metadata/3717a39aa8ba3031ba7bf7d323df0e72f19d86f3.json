When Kyle, unkempt and in dirty fatigues, stops in a small town for some food, the local bullies can't wait for an opportunity to harass him. After Kyle uses his Special Forces training to escape the bullies, he becomes the subject of a community-wide manhunt. Only Jenny Bellows, a local girl whose husband was declared missing in action in Vietnam, is willing to give Kyle a chance. \n\n\tDirk Benedict\t... \tKyle Hanson\n\tLinda Blair\t... \tJenny Bellows\n\tRichard Farnsworth\t... \tSheriff Jethro Pough\n\tMatt Clark\t... \tCecil 'Cece' Grant\n\tJon Van Ness\t... \tDeputy Dave\n\tTaylor Lacher\t... \tSarge\n\tClifford A.

Even The Hunted (Benicio Del Toro) and Red Rock West (a great neo-noir from Jonathan Dahl) appear to be different takes and may have been inspired by the book and/or film. The book was released in 1972 and was in development hell for the better part of 10 years, so studios knew about it. Many erroneously think of First Blood the movie ripping some of these films off, not realizing it was the book that was actually being ripped off.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3717a39aa8ba3031ba7bf7d323df0e72f19d86f3","amp;dn":"Ruckus.avi+1981","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3717a39aa8ba3031ba7bf7d323df0e72f19d86f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,23,163,154,168,186,48,49,186,123,247,211,35,223,14,114,241,157,134,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
