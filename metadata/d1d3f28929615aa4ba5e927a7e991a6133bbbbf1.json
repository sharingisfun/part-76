He also translated many books of Abdolkarim Soroush into Arabic.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/95c96f9c962b9bbfdcf517cb84366dc34b176ec8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/95c96f9c962b9bbfdcf517cb84366dc34b176ec8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1d3f28929615aa4ba5e927a7e991a6133bbbbf1","amp;dn":"Ahmed+Al-Gubbanchi+-+Batch+%23+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1d3f28929615aa4ba5e927a7e991a6133bbbbf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,211,242,137,41,97,90,164,186,94,146,122,126,153,26,97,51,187,187,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
