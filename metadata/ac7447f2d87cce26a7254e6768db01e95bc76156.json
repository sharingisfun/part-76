On the way, she tries to seduce Audie by offering to give him Duryea's share of the money if he will help her achieve her real goal: kill Duryea for having killed her husband. Audie dreams of getting enough money to buy a ranch of his own, but his loyalty to his friend prevails. In the end, however, Murphy is forced to kill Duryea in a shootout when Duryea draws on him in a greedy attempt to finish the job even though continuing will likely get all three of them killed. After the shootout Duryea gets his final wish: a funeral carriage pulled by - you guessed it - six black horses. \n\nUser Review\n\nThere is no comparison between the westerns Murphy did in the fifties with those made in the sixties. Six Black Horses has the excellent Dan Duryea and the interesting Joan O'Brien but the great outdoor action scenes of films like `The Kansas Raiders', `The Cimarron Kid' or `Duel at Silver Creek' are missing. Duryea is a hired killer who saves Murphy's life and Joan O'Brien the woman who hires them both to take her to a town which is very hard to reach because of the `Coyoteros'. Duryea's character has the peculiar name of Frank Jesse, his mother must have been an admirer of the James Brothers. Bob Steele who was the main actor in so many C Westerns shows up briefly at the beginning. Duryea, in spite of being a hired killer, is such a likeable character with good feelings in relation to Murphy that you keep wishing there will be no showdown between them.
