Don't need FLAC/AC3/AAC, MP3 is just fine.\n.\nJust to be clear. I've CAREFULLY thought out just what I'm doing here.\nEverybody knocks the &quot;fast food restaurant&quot; and nobody knocks &quot;fine quisine&quot;.\nBut you get nowhere just listening to people. You have to watch what they do.\nI'll bet a good 97% of the people here have eaten at a &quot;fast food restaurant&quot;\n100 times as often as they've gone out for &quot;fine quisine&quot;.\n.\nThere are those who show up regularly insisting that I'm getting my &quot;fine quisine&quot;\nall wrong and they are oh-so-helpful about how I can improve my recipe.\nAnd then there are those who think me something of an amateurish cheat (SURE).\n.\nTwo of my favorite movies are &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;\n(famous &quot;put your lips together and blow&quot; scene)\nand &quot;The Valley Obscured by Clouds&quot; (Pink Floyd did the soundtrack)\nI want to watch them ***BÃƒÂ¨ÃƒÂ ÃƒÂ¹TÃƒÂ®FÃƒÂ¼L***, saw the second as a brand new 35mm print.\nI'm an ex-projectionist and I KNOW QUALITY (it aint here).\n.\nBut last night's sitcom is on over there while I'm fixing dinner over here and half\nthe time I'm not looking at the screen. Again, QUALITY (it aint here).\n.\nIt should look and sound reasonably &quot;OK&quot; and not have any annoying defects,\nglitches or sync problems. If you're looking close for QUALITY, (it aint here).\n.\nServing burgers as fast as one man can. If you don't like the fare, that's AOK.\nIf you think you can do batter, then by all means, I encourage you to do it so\nwell that you put me to shame and run me out of the business. I need a break.\n.\nThe exit fee is exactly the same as the entrance fee.\nPlease see the Concierge at the main exit to get your hovercraft validated.\n.\nAVIGUY\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b557846e0be61d076805bffdadf534ad5c9d3ee0","amp;dn":"The.Daily.Show.2012.12.12.Cory.Booker.PROPER.XVID-AVIGUY.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b557846e0be61d076805bffdadf534ad5c9d3ee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,87,132,110,11,230,29,7,104,5,191,253,173,245,52,173,92,157,62,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
