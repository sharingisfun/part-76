Anubis, the Lord of the Necropolis, was chosen to bestow a portion of his might upon a worthy champion. The Anubis Warrior's powers passed from champion to champion throughout the ages until the evil was vanquished. And then those powers slumbered. When a young man discovers an amulet deep within a pyramid in Egypt, he is drawn into the struggle of the gods - as the threats from the past return to reclaim the planet once more - as this age's first Anubis Warrior!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed3efec67e7b9db3c5768acab0f107adff9e0af4","amp;dn":"Anubis+Warrior+%282010%29+%5BArcana+Studio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed3efec67e7b9db3c5768acab0f107adff9e0af4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,62,254,198,126,123,157,179,197,118,138,202,176,241,7,173,255,158,10,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
