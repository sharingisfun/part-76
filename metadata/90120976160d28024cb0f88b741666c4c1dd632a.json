Aided by a radically time-shuffling narrative, razor-sharp dialogue from pulp novelist Jim Thompson, and a phenomenal cast of character actors, including Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray, Timothy Carey, Elisha Cook Jr., and Marie Windsor, The Killing is both a jaunty thriller and a cold-blooded punch to the gut. And with its precise tracking shots and gratifying sense of irony, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kubrick to the core.\n\n\n\n1956\n84 minutes\nBlack and White\n1.66:1\nNTSC, R1\n\nDisc 1\nNew digital restoration\n\nNew video interview with producer James B Harris\n\nExcerpted interviews with actor Sterling Hayden from the French television series Cinema cinemas\n\nNew video interview with poet and author Robert Polito about writer Jim Thompson\n\n\nDisc 2\nRestored high definition digital transfer of Stanley Kubricks 1955 noir feature Killers Kiss\n\nNew video appreciation of Killers Kiss featuring film critic Geoffrey OBrien\n\nTrailers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90120976160d28024cb0f88b741666c4c1dd632a","amp;dn":"The+Killing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90120976160d28024cb0f88b741666c4c1dd632a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,18,9,118,22,13,40,2,76,176,248,139,116,22,102,196,193,221,99,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
