The group's kind of an answer to the Soulful Strings ensemble headed by Richard Evans for Cadet/Concept in Chicago Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and like that group, it mixes up funky rhythms with some sweet large orchestrations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in a style that's almost a precursor of blacksploitation funk to come in the 70s! Paul Riser handles arrangements Ã¢â‚¬â€œ very much in the same spirit of Evans Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and he picks up a hip Motown groove that bridges sweeping soul and gritty funk Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all played to perfection by an ensemble led by Gordon Staples, and featuring players from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra! There's lots of funky nuggets in the set Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and titles include excellent originals like &quot;Strung Out&quot;, &quot;Toonie&quot;, and &quot;Sounds of the Zodiac&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ plus &quot;The April Fools&quot;, &quot;The Look Of Love&quot;, &quot;Get Down&quot;, &quot;If Your Love Were Mine&quot;, &quot;Someday We'll Be Together&quot;, and &quot;From A Heart That's True To Only You&quot;. ~Dusty Groove","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:501ed07286af6aa82da700bcea0161921854d685","amp;dn":"Gordon+Staples+And+The+String+Thing+-+Strung+Out+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"501ed07286af6aa82da700bcea0161921854d685","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,30,208,114,134,175,106,168,45,167,0,188,234,1,97,146,24,84,214,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
