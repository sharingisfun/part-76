Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) joined the show to talk about the Democratic momentum behind the fiscal cliff negotiations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republicans tried out a bizarre new attack on Ambassador Susan Rice: Questioning her handling of embassy attacks in 1998. Karen Finney (MSNBC Political Analyst) helped sort out the truth from the smears.\n\nLatino voters helped but President Obama over the top, and now the Congressional Hispanic Caucus says they want action. They're laying out a plan for immigration reform, and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) joined Ed to explain.\n\nAnd in the BIG Finish, President Obama is going to keep a promise he made on Election Night and have a private lunch with Mitt Romney on Thursday. Bob Shrum (New York University Senior Fellow, Daily Beast contributor) went on the show with his reaction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0732035a8b089ceca59e09cfe73133ab29d6c645","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+11-28-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0732035a8b089ceca59e09cfe73133ab29d6c645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,50,3,90,139,8,156,236,165,158,9,207,231,49,51,171,41,214,198,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
