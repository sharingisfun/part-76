He is talented, but he has no guts. His uncontrollable appetite is an even bigger problem. He canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put himself in the right weight class, he runs out of energy because of hunger, and he gets knocked out while his eyes are set on food at the ringside. However, KosakuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life changed when he met Sister Angela, a novice nun in the convent near his boxing gym. She became the source of his power, and Kosaku fights only to win her heart.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:228fd620d97744b6bef8c45763334e0e62d1dd34","amp;dn":"1+Pound+Gospel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"228fd620d97744b6bef8c45763334e0e62d1dd34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,143,214,32,217,119,68,182,190,248,196,87,99,51,78,14,98,209,221,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
