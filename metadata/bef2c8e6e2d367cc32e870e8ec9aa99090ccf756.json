Competition and petty jealousy consume faculty and students, with an end-of-first-semester best-student award held out as a grand plum. Worse, a strangler is on the loose, killing people on or next to campus. The idealistic Jerome falls in love with Audrey, a student who models for life-drawing classes and who responds to his sweetness. But he has a rival: the clean-cut, manly Jonah, also a first-year drawing student, whose primitive work draws raves and Audrey's attention. As cynicism seems to corrode everything, Jerome is desperate to win. \n\nCats :\nMax Minghella   \t ...  \tJerome\nSophia Myles \t... \tAudrey\nJohn Malkovich \t... \tProfessor Sandiford\nJim Broadbent \t... \tJimmy\nMatt Keeslar \t... \tJonah\nEthan Suplee \t... \tVince\nJoel David Moore \t... \tBardo\nNick Swardson \t... \tMatthew\nAnjelica Huston \t... \tArt History Teacher\nAdam Scott \t... \tMarvin Bushmiller\nJack Ong \t... \tProfessor Okamura\nScoot McNairy \t... \tArmy-Jacket\nJeremy Guskin \t... \tEno\nMonika Ramnath \t... \tFlower\nIsaac Laskin \t... \tKiss-Ass \n\nData Technical :\nAudio.....: English\nSubtitles.: Spanish .srt, English .srt, Polish .txt\n516x272, DX50, FFODVIX, 23.0, 836 kb/s, MP3, 112 kb/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bef2c8e6e2d367cc32e870e8ec9aa99090ccf756","amp;dn":"Art+School+Confidential","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bef2c8e6e2d367cc32e870e8ec9aa99090ccf756","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,242,200,230,226,211,103,204,50,232,112,232,236,154,169,144,144,204,247,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
