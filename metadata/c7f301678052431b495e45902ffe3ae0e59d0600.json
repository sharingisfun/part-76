Here are just a few features that his upcoming mod will include:\n\n- overall purpose of the mod is to increase Geralts responsiveness and mobility\n- Geralt can parry attacks while hes walking and running (new animations)\n- Geralt reacts faster to keyboard/gamepad buttons\n- active block was replaced by active Quen\n- during heavy battle Geralt uses pirouettes and focus (new animations)\n- difficulty levels were rebalanced\n- Geralt does not bump away from opponents swords when his attacks are parried which allows quick continuation of the attack sequence\n- opponents explode when particular attacks are used, e.g. Igni causes opponent explosion, just like in The Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition intro\n- elixirs have negative influence\n\nSource: Neogaf.com \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTHIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL GAME 'The Witcher 2' - This is a mod for it.\n\nI made this torrent because the redkit.cdprojektred.com website is down from too much traffic.\n\nThe is one .exe file zipped up. This is exactly how it was served up the day it came out on June 20, 2013.\n\nThe MD5 hash of the .exe is 9F74DACF44974B4675C210411D909844\nPlease verify that in comments once redkits website is back up.\n\nRead carefully the prompts when installing, as you may not actually want every single sub-mod that is offered. If you mess up, you can use Windows UNINSTALL feature to just remove the FCR itself, and not your whole Witcher2 install (Nice!)\n\nMany of us, have never paid for the Witcher1 or 2. Now is the time to show your financial support to this truly epic game developer by purchasing it. Both games are now in the $5 - $10 range, DRM free, at GOG.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7f301678052431b495e45902ffe3ae0e59d0600","amp;dn":"The.Witcher2.Full.Combat.Rebalance2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7f301678052431b495e45902ffe3ae0e59d0600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,243,1,103,128,82,67,27,73,94,69,144,47,254,58,224,229,157,6,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
