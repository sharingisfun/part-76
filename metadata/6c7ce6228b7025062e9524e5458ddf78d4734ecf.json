For Blake, passing his final assessment is the only thing that stands between him and his dream job...\n\nBut a crucial error threatens to derail the promise of a new career. Having passed his final test Reynir finds himself on the road with six-year paramedic, Mel. It's a Saturday night, the full moon is out and a drug overdose is Reynir's first official job as a paramedic. It's an unpredictable and potentially explosive situation for the fresh-faced recruit. For rookie paramedics, dealing with situations on the street is very different to the classroom environment. Despite the best training possible, nothing can prepare them for the unforeseeable circumstances that confront them on a daily basis. As for young Blake, he manages to scrape through his final test at College but his real test now awaits him. Life on the road as a paramedic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c7ce6228b7025062e9524e5458ddf78d4734ecf","amp;dn":"Recruits+Paramedics%3A+Episode+11+Season+1+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c7ce6228b7025062e9524e5458ddf78d4734ecf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,124,230,34,139,112,37,6,46,149,36,229,69,141,223,120,212,115,78,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
