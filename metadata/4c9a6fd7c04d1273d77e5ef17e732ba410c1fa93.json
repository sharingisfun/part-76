A rend that would threaten to tear not only the country, but families apart! This is the true story of one family in Maropati, Italy, during the Feast of the Epiphany. Beautifully illustrated, this embellished tale comes directly from Cavallaro's grandparents, in stories passed down from generations into a master storyteller's hands.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c9a6fd7c04d1273d77e5ef17e732ba410c1fa93","amp;dn":"Parade+%28With+Fireworks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c9a6fd7c04d1273d77e5ef17e732ba410c1fa93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,154,111,215,192,77,18,115,215,126,94,241,126,115,43,164,16,193,250,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
