Papa DocÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reign was very brutal and any deviation from the rule was punishable by death or torture. A young girl is exposed to the brutality of the Tonton Macoute (the private secret police and militia that Papa Doc used to terrorize Haitians for 29 years. She does not understand all the ramifications of what she sees, but through her auntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s agony and fears and ultimately arrest, she knows that life around her is not good and there is a lot of sadness and sorrow too. The pace of the movie also convey very well the fact that people are trapped in this world and it seems that it will last forever. The use of very somber colours add to the evil atmosphere that lingers on the town. Ã¢â‚¬â€œIMDb\n\nPLEASE SEED AS MUCH AS YOU DOWNLOAD!
