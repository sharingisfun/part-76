It transforms situations and relationships. It converts hostility into civility and civility into affinity. It changes the skeptics and cynics into the believers and the undecided into the loyal. Enchantment can happen during a retail transaction, a high-level corporate negotiation, or a Facebook update. And when done right, it's more powerful than traditional persuasion, influence, or marketing techniques.\n\nKawasaki argues that in business and personal interactions, your goal is not merely to get what you want but to bring about a voluntary, enduring, and delightful change in other people. By enlisting their own goals and desires, by being likable and trustworthy, and by framing a cause that others can embrace, you can change hearts, minds, and actions. For instance, enchantment is what enabled . . .\n\n* A Peace Corps volunteer to finesse a potentially violent confrontation with armed guerrillas.\n* A small cable channel (E!) to win the TV broadcast rights to radio superstar Howard Stern.??\n* A seemingly crazy new running shoe (Vibram Five Fingers) to methodically build a passionate customer base.??\n* A Canadian crystal maker (Nova Scotian Crystal) to turn observers into buyers. \n\nThis book explains all the tactics you need to prepare and launch an enchantment campaign; to get the most from both push and pull technologies; and to enchant your customers, your employees, and even your boss. It shows how enchantment can turn difficult decisions your way, at times when intangibles mean more than hard facts. It will help you overcome other people's entrenched habits and defy the not-always-wise &quot;wisdom of the crowd.&quot;\n\nKawasaki's lessons are drawn from his tenure at one of the most enchanting organizations of all time, Apple, as well as his decades of experience as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. There are few people in the world more qualified to teach you how to enchant people.\n\nAs Kawasaki writes, &quot;Want to change the world? Change caterpillars into butterflies? This takes more than run-of-the-mill relationships. You need to convince people to dream the same dream that you do.&quot; That's a big goal, but one that's possible for all of us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbeb4175cbb683afe4356f97a28ab186bcb0627c","amp;dn":"Enchantment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbeb4175cbb683afe4356f97a28ab186bcb0627c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,235,65,117,203,182,131,175,228,53,111,151,162,138,177,134,188,176,98,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
