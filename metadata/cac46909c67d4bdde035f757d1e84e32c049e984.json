Starring David Wenham and Diana Glenn.\n\n\nAll episodes are in 960 x 720p, 4200 kbps, x264, mkv and Stereo AAC audio.\n\nI've compiled these from various Russian sites and removed the Russian audio track. The source files I believe are from iTunes, and even though they are somewhat less sharp compared with other 720p WEB-DLs, these are the best available versions.\n\nEarlier uploaded here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8498279/Killing_Time_(AUS__2011)_Complete_Series_720p_WEB-DL_and_WEB-DLR, but that was a mixed set, and this is the complete series in 720p, so if you have the files from that torrent, simply add them to the new folder and download the rest.\n\nA fine series, and not widely available, so I hope you keep it alive by seeding after you download!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cac46909c67d4bdde035f757d1e84e32c049e984","amp;dn":"Killing+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cac46909c67d4bdde035f757d1e84e32c049e984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,196,105,9,198,125,75,221,224,53,247,87,209,232,78,50,192,73,233,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
