However, odd things have been happening to Aya lately. She has been falling down often and walks strange. Her mother, Shioka, takes Aya to see the doctor, and he informs Shioka that Aya has spinocerebellar degeneration - a terrible disease where the cerebellum of the brain gradually deteriorates to the point where the victim cannot walk, speak, write, or eat. A cruel disease, as it does not affect the mind in the least. How will Aya react when told about her disease? And how will Aya live from now on?\n\nEpisode 01\nHardsubbed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b6435a4f4f4b38b1a573312d5bf84c6cd3d679","amp;dn":"1+Litre+of+Tears+-+01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b6435a4f4f4b38b1a573312d5bf84c6cd3d679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,182,67,90,79,79,75,56,177,165,115,49,45,91,248,76,108,211,214,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
