Cucci's claims were refuted by the Navy and I think he ended up on the SEAL &quot;Wall of Shame&quot;. Anyway, Frank WAS a SEAL and he is a big Jeet Kune Do guy. There's some valuable stuff here regardless. Included is one of Frank's old Panther Productions (now out of business) vids as well as two newer ones. Also rhere's a stick fighting video. \n\nPlease seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c7f253b0ae4d63b4c99feeb40f24f8c2d232091","amp;dn":"Seal+Combatives+-+Frank+Cucci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c7f253b0ae4d63b4c99feeb40f24f8c2d232091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,127,37,59,10,228,214,59,76,153,254,235,64,242,79,140,45,35,32,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
