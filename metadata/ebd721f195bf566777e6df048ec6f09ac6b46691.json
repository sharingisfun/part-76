He finds the map to the gold on Taggart's boot. Joe Laikon and his men are also after the gold and they overpower Morgan, get the map, and head for the treasure. But Morgan and Tod Grant are soon on their trail. \n\nUser Review\n\nPretty good Western script with a great performance by Ken Maynard make this a must-see movie.\n\nOf course any movie with Charles King is also a must-see, but Maynard and King are surrounded by players ranging from capable to excellent.\n\nGeorge Chesebro gets a rare chance to play a good guy; Wally West gets another unbilled part; Reed Howes and Bob Terry had small parts which they handled very well.\n\nWilliam Gould had what might now be called a cameo, but he might have been the smoothest actor in the entire cast. I thought he showed ability, subtlety, presence enough to have been a major performer. He did have a very long career, anyway.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebd721f195bf566777e6df048ec6f09ac6b46691","amp;dn":"Lightning+Strikes+West+%28Western%29+%7BKen+Maynard%7D+%5B1940%5D+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebd721f195bf566777e6df048ec6f09ac6b46691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,215,33,241,149,191,86,103,119,230,223,4,142,198,240,154,198,180,102,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
