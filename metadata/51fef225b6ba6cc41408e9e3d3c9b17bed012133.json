You see, a tale is an account of things in their due order, often divulged secretly, or as gossip. Would you like to hear one?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Lord Autumn\n\nUncle Ebb was so good at telling his tales of the Moon Realm that sometimes it sounded like heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been there himself.\n\nAs children, Lily and Jasper listened raptly to his bedtime tales of a place where nine moons swirled around one another, each inhabited by strange and wondrous beings: magical lunamancers; undersea merfolk; wise birds; winged dragons; and LilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite, the heroic, leonine Rinn.\n\nThere was only one rule: donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell a soul.\n\nBut now, years later, Uncle Ebb is missing. Lily has learned the secret behind the tales, and soon Jasper will too. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one big problem. You see, something terrible has happened in the Moon Realm. . . .\n\nIllustrated by Carolyn Arcabascio. Book One in the award winning Moon Realm Series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51fef225b6ba6cc41408e9e3d3c9b17bed012133","amp;dn":"The+Moon+Coin+EPUB.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51fef225b6ba6cc41408e9e3d3c9b17bed012133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,254,242,37,182,186,108,196,20,8,233,227,211,201,177,123,237,1,33,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
