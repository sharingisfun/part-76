Written over 40 years ago by the future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, at the behest of the US Chamber of Commerce, the 6-page memo, a free-market utopian treatise, called for a money fueled big business makeover of government through corporate control of the media, academia, the pulpit, arts and sciences and destruction of organized labor and consumer protection groups.\n\nBut PowellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real Ã¢â‚¬Å“end gameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was business control of law and politics. HEISTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s step by step detail exposes the systemic implementation of PowellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memo by BOTH U.S. political parties culminating in the deregulation of industry, outsourcing of jobs and regressive taxation. All of which led us to the global financial crisis of 2008 and the continued dismantling of the American middle class. Today, politics is the playground of the rich and powerful, with no thought given to the hopes and dreams of ordinary Americans. No other film goes as deeply as HEIST in explaining the greatest wealth transfer of our time. Moving beyond the white noise of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s polarizing media, HEIST provides viewers with a clear, concise and fact- based explanation of how we got into this mess, and what we need to do to restore our representative democracy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c63b36aacfb30e2f67991ce48cf4c50548fbf3f","amp;dn":"Heist%3A+Who+Stole+the+American+Dream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c63b36aacfb30e2f67991ce48cf4c50548fbf3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,99,179,106,172,251,48,226,246,121,145,206,72,207,76,80,84,143,191,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
