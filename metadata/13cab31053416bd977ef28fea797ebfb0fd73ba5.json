You name the place and the sound, and it's here: from all over Europe (England, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, and Denmark), the U.S., Canada, and Brazil comes hard rock in all shapes and styles, from radio-friendly pop-metal to heavier thrash and speed-metal to extreme forms like gothic, industrial, and death metal. If you're already a fan of the genre, you can discover bands you most likely haven't heard before; if you're not, four hours of head-banging probably won't change your mind. But for those already converted, here's a golden opportunity to widen your metal outlook: Brazil's thrash-metal quartet Sepultura's heavy-duty cover of U2's &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; and stalwarts Iron Maiden's live version of its classic &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; are the exceptions to the rule of unfamiliar or new bands showing off their considerable metal chops. And this is just volume 1; volume 2 also contains 50 videos from 50 different artists. Bonuses include three live clips and the &quot;Dr. Blast Show,&quot; 25 minutes' worth of prime music by 10 up-and-coming groups\n\nTracklist:\n\nDVD1\n01. MANOWAR - Warriors Of The World United\n02.
