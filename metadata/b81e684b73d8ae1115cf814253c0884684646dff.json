The \nfirst production of the opera since Vivaldi's time was at Spoleto in 2006 in a \nversion by Alessandro Ciccolini, which was released as a DVD. Conductor \nFabio Biondi made a version introduced in Venice in 2007, which is recorded \non this 2010 Virgin CD. Biondi's recording has the advantage of two \ninternational superstars in the leading roles, tenor Rolando VillazÃƒÂ³n and \nmezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, and soprano Diana Damrau is nearly in their \nleague. VillazÃƒÂ³n's earthy voice is usually associated with 19th century and \nverismo Italian repertoire, but he has an acute sensitivity to Baroque vocal \nstyle, and his robust, almost baritonal tenor is entirely appropriate for a \nlarger-than-life character like Hercules. DiDonato excels as Hippolyta, Queen \nof the Amazons, singing with her characteristic brilliance and warm humanity. \nThe rest of the cast consists mostly of singers who are superstars or near-\nsuperstars in the more circumscribed world of Baroque opera: soprano \nPatrizia Ciofi, mezzo-sopranos Vivica Genaux and Romina Basso (who sounds \nlike a genuine contralto), counter tenor Philippe Jaroussky, and tenor Topi \nLehtipuu. The vocal standards are predictably high; the singers are in \nabsolute control of Vivaldi's extreme demands and they have the ease with \nthe repertoire to make it sound spontaneous and effortless. These are all \nperformers with exceptionally lovely voices -- pure, velvety, colorful, and \nsupple -- so the recording should be a pleasure for any fans of vocal music. \nThe singers are also superb actors, and the eight leads create distinctly \ndifferentiated characters. Biondi leads Europa Galante in a performance of \nexquisite precision and refinement (although the natural horns used in some \narias add an appropriately rough-hewn quality to the warriors' music), and \nthe continuo parts are especially beautifully realized. The sound is clean, \ndetailed, and spacious, with excellent balance.\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 2/15/2011\nEAN: 5099969454509\nLabel: Virgin Classics\nCatalog Number: 94545\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b81e684b73d8ae1115cf814253c0884684646dff","amp;dn":"Antonio+Vivaldi+-+Ercole+sul+Termodonte+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b81e684b73d8ae1115cf814253c0884684646dff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,30,104,75,115,216,174,17,21,207,129,66,83,192,136,70,132,100,109,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
