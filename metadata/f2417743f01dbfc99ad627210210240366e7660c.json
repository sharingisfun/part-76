Frankland initially treated it as a solo project, playing many shows in Akron, Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh. After developing a devoted local following, Frankland decided to independently release Slackeye Slims debut album, Texas Whore Pleaser.\n\n\nTexas Whore Pleaser came out on Christmas Day of 2007. Described by Truth About Music as a lo-fi alt country sound that was soaked in Dead Kennedys and Black Flag tributes, Slackeye SlimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album featured a guest vocal appearance by Lonesome Wyatt (Those Poor Bastards) and saw a track included on Devils Ruin Records 2008 compilation, Rodentia: The Best of Dark Roots Music.\n\nSlackeye Slim (aka Joe Frankland), the man who was born with an evil eye, has performed all over the United States and opened for Slim Cessnas Auto Club, The Legendary Shack Shakers, and Those Poor Bastards. Currently, Frankland lives a reclusive life in rural southwest Wisconsin where he is continuing to develop new material for Slackeye Slim.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2417743f01dbfc99ad627210210240366e7660c","amp;dn":"Slackeye+Slim+-++Texas+Whore+Pleaser+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2417743f01dbfc99ad627210210240366e7660c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,65,119,67,240,29,191,201,154,214,39,33,2,16,36,3,102,231,102,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
