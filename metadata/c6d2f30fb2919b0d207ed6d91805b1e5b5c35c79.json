It works by temporarily stopping system processes and then, after you play that really good game, or run that really big program, you go 'back to normal mode'. Its really simple and yet so useful.\n\nFreeware: This software is FREEWARE and is distributed with permission from IObit.\n\nDownload Game Booster Portable Development Test 1\n4.2 MB Download, 14 MB Installed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6d2f30fb2919b0d207ed6d91805b1e5b5c35c79","amp;dn":"Game+Booster+Portable+3.4.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6d2f30fb2919b0d207ed6d91805b1e5b5c35c79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,210,243,15,178,145,155,13,32,126,214,217,24,5,177,229,181,195,92,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
