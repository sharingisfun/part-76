Watch as Rapunzel and her amazing hair team up with Jack (of beanstalk fame) to gallop around the wild and western landscape, changing lives, righting wrongs, and bringing joy to every soul they encounter.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50948fc2d004c4b9df09d0e5450a0aeca4f58818","amp;dn":"Rapunzel%27s+Revenge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50948fc2d004c4b9df09d0e5450a0aeca4f58818","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,148,143,194,208,4,196,185,223,9,208,229,69,10,10,236,164,245,136,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
