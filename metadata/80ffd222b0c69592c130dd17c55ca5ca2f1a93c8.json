They didn't have time to learn and many probably didn't want to. A little boot-stompin', a shuffle or a mild sway did for many. Others knew only the two-step or the waltz. Ever notice how much of the old-time music is in 2/2 or 3/4 time? There is a reason.\n\nThis album is packed with modern-but-authentic old-timey stuff, all of it reeking of barn dance. Slow waltz (Comoto Waltz). Fast waltz (Sins of Her Sisters). Two-step (and a fast oneÃ¢â‚¬â€Satan's Bait). Regular two-step (Joy and Pain, which has an eerily close resemblance to what the Grateful Dead used to play at times). And the obligatory hoe-down (Fly Around My Pretty Little Pink, a very Darlin' Boys arrangement).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80ffd222b0c69592c130dd17c55ca5ca2f1a93c8","amp;dn":"Mayhem+String+Band++-++Land+pirates+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80ffd222b0c69592c130dd17c55ca5ca2f1a93c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,255,210,34,176,198,149,146,193,48,221,23,197,92,165,202,47,26,147,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
