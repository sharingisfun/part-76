In this work, influenced by Michelangelo Antonioni, JancsÃƒÂ³ created the unique visual style by which he became known - the mesmerizing, sweeping, ballet-like camera movement, which emphasize the relation between the characters and the landscape, the vast Hungarian plain, around them. In considering the latter aspect, JancsÃƒÂ³'s cinematic world has connections with the traditional western, although not on the ideological level. Movement is for JancsÃƒÂ³ both a guiding philosophical and aesthetical principle - &quot;Is seems to me that life is a continual movement,&quot; he once summarized. &quot;It's physical and it's also philosophical: the contradiction is founded on movement, the movement of ideas, the movement of masses.&quot; \n\nJancsÃƒÂ³'s approach differed radically from Eisenstein's theory of montage editing, in which duration has only a marginal importance. In JancsÃƒÂ³, a shot lasts as long as it would &quot;in reality&quot;. Thus the time of the film and that of the action become synchronous - as in theatre, the audience experiences the time as the characters in the drama. \n\nIn Cantata, photographed by TamÃƒÂ¡s SomlÃƒÂ³, JancsÃƒÂ³ used only 12 or 13 camera setups. The film was shot in 11 days. From 1965 Jancso's favorite cinematographer was JÃƒÂ¡nos Kende, who was not opposed to doing 360-turns with camera. Other regular collaborators have been the novelist Gyula HernÃƒÂ¡di, who started to write scripts for JancsÃƒÂ³ in the early 1960s, and the actors JÃƒÂ³zsef Madaras and Lajos BalÃƒÂ¡zsovits\n\n---------------------------------\n\n1,399 MB \nXvid \n704x528 (1.33:1) [=4:3] \n1977 kb/s \n0.213 bits/pixel \n25.000 FPS \nac3 (0x2000) Dolby Laboratories, Inc \n192 kb/s (96/ch, stereo) CBR \n48000 Hz\n\n---------------------------------\n\nNot my rip.\n\nSubs: English, french and portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bdcc3db1b43279ac9c4469f094db48e333a78de","amp;dn":"Miklos+Jancso+-+Cantata+%281963%29+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bdcc3db1b43279ac9c4469f094db48e333a78de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,220,195,219,27,67,39,154,201,196,70,159,9,77,180,142,51,58,120,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
