It covers most of the published Wizards material as well as helpful collections that accompany that.\n\nThis is an update of my earlier torrent and includes a large number of non-Wizards works which more than doubled the resulting size of the collection.\n\nThere were too many files to include them all separately - TPB's upload system wouldn't accept the resulting file, so I've bound them into a single zip file.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8752ca4b7e690d89fb404c7524c5d2b9d44ba81","amp;dn":"D%26amp%3BD+d20+3.5+Mega+Books+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8752ca4b7e690d89fb404c7524c5d2b9d44ba81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,117,44,164,183,230,144,216,159,180,4,199,82,76,93,43,157,68,186,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
