(Although VLC is good, MPC plays even MORE file-types with awesome quality - and that same portability).\n\nHope you enjoy the torrent, and PLEASE SEED, as I can (usually) only seed at night!!!  I don't know much about torrents, but I used the fastest trackers I could find so the download should be bearable.  Emphasis on 'should'.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009f7926b853786334f01c1300058b6294ae52c6","amp;dn":"GTO+-+The+Complete+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009f7926b853786334f01c1300058b6294ae52c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,159,121,38,184,83,120,99,52,240,28,19,0,5,139,98,148,174,82,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
