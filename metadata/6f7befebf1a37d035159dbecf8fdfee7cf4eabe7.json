Hilarity ensues. Later, they turn everyone in prison on to LSD. Finally, after Carol Channing and lots of hippies get onto the former-secret yacht and find Groucho Marx, it ends with Groucho smoking a joint in a smaller boat, and everyone is OK. \n\nOther actors in it include: Frankie Avalon, Frank Gorshin, Peter Lawford, Burgess Meredith, George Raft, Cesar Romero...wow, that's a lot of famous actors.\n\nAnd...it is in color.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f7befebf1a37d035159dbecf8fdfee7cf4eabe7","amp;dn":"Skidoo+%281968%29+GOOD+QUALITY+-+Otto+Preminger.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f7befebf1a37d035159dbecf8fdfee7cf4eabe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,123,239,235,241,163,125,3,81,89,219,236,248,253,254,231,207,78,171,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
