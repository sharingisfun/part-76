Your adventure begins on the shores of a remote island called Eden. Long ago, Eden was inhabited by a group of indigenous people, whose extant monuments still decorate the island landscape. Eden is now home to a scientific research outpost, and it is your hope to reunite with your colleagues working there. Unfortunately, you'll soon discover that something has gone terribly wrong.\n\nDuring your adventure, you will encounter a mysterious and deadly creature. This creature can stalk you for miles, lurking behind grasses and vegetative cover. By treading carefully and quietly, you may be able to elude it. If you're careless, however, you will be forced to confront the creature head-on.\n\nThe island of Eden is filled with dozens of plants and fungi, many of which have unique medicinal properties. Some of these plants hold the secret to curing the plague, so you must harvest them and run lab experiments to determine their worth.\n\nExploration is a key component of the game. You can use landmarks, such as ruins and statues, to triangulate your location and construct a map of Eden's boundaries and contours.\n\nBonus content: manual, soundtrack, wallpaper.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Run setup_miasmata_2.0.0.4.exe and install the game;\n2) Launch the game using main executable or shortcuts (DRM free).\n\nIf you like the game, BUY it!\n\nwww.gog.com/gamecard/miasmata","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:614b9579eb3190d115d1ac50128be60a03a5f85f","amp;dn":"Miasmata++GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"614b9579eb3190d115d1ac50128be60a03a5f85f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,75,149,121,235,49,144,209,21,209,172,80,18,139,230,10,3,165,248,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
