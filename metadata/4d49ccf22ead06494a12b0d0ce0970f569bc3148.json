It's a whole week of broncos bucking, guitars twanging, and cash registers ringing. Nobody much wants to spoil the party, not even when a local loser turns up dead in the mountains east of town.\n\nAlmost nobody. Sally Adler and Hawk Green, a couple of college professors out for an afternoon hike, find the body, and for Sally and Hawk, murder is anything but academic. Like the victim, Sally's done her time in the glare of the late-night neon lights, and she knows how thin the line can be between honky-tonk angels and lost souls. She's determined to do what she can to see justice. Hawk knows he'd better stay close and keep his eyes open. Sally has a way of attracting the wrong kind of attention.\n\nFrom the jam-packed barrooms to the wide-open spaces, Sally and Hawk unravel the dark threads of a sinister scheme. It's a race to find the killer before Sally becomes the next victim.\n\nPublisher: Harper; 1st edition (May 28, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0060195541\nISBN-13: 978-0060195540","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d49ccf22ead06494a12b0d0ce0970f569bc3148","amp;dn":"Mustang+Sally+Mystery+02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d49ccf22ead06494a12b0d0ce0970f569bc3148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,73,204,242,46,173,6,73,74,18,176,208,206,9,112,245,105,188,49,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
