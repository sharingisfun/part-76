For most people, the equator is just an imaginary line around the globe but in this series Simon Reeve comes face-to-face with the reality. On a 40,000-kilometre journey, he reveals the equator as a unique region of our planet; home to both the world's greatest concentration of human poverty and natural biodiversity. Beneath the sweltering heat of the equatorial sun lie paradise beaches, strange foods and exotic wildlife, along with some of the world's most extreme terrains: dense rainforests, towering volcanoes and perilous rapids.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7b5bd0188cef14ec4a1a8e169599fdfd4f4001e","amp;dn":"Equator+with+Simon+Reece+++%28BBC+2007+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7b5bd0188cef14ec4a1a8e169599fdfd4f4001e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,181,189,1,136,206,241,78,196,161,168,225,105,89,159,223,212,244,0,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
