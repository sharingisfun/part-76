But that's only the beginning of a new series of shocking revelations that lead towards a dark secret plan that not even the unbelievable power of her War God Mode may be able to withstand. Still, Medaka's proving to be good at thinking outside of the box, and if she needs the full backing of every hidden resource of the Student Council to meet the challenge, then that's what she's going to get. Even the Abnormal ones! \n\n\n\nRelease date : November 09, 2012\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language : English\n\n\nGenres : Action, Comedy, Ecchi, Martial Arts, Romance, School, Shounen\n\n\nProducers : Gainax","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aafa845fc4790776f52be5ed9ab423f247084f3","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Medaka+Box+S2+-+05+%5B1080p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aafa845fc4790776f52be5ed9ab423f247084f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,175,168,69,252,71,144,119,111,82,190,94,217,171,66,63,36,112,132,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
