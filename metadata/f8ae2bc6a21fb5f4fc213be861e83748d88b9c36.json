Martin famously took years to finish Feast after Storm came out, and infamously took even more years to finish Dance after Feast came out. As we know, this came down to several problems. First, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d intended to have a five-year jump in the narrative following the conclusion of Storm, but after about a year of writing he realized it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t working and had to start over. Then, once heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d started over, he discovered that while the five-year jump didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work for most of the storylines, it worked really well for a few, and it was hard to get them right without it. Then he realized that he had way too many characters and way too much story to fit in one volume as planned, and he needed to decide how to split one volume into two Ã¢â‚¬â€œ should he tell half the story for all the characters, or (nearly) all the story for half the characters? (He chose the latter solution.) Finally, he struggled with something called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Meereenese Knot.&quot; To discuss this IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to get a little bit spoilery, but it boiled down to how to get a whole bunch of characters to the place where a certain other character was, and in what order, and whether to have all of them get there by the end of Dance, and what to do with the character toward whom theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re traveling while theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on their way.
