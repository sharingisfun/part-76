Everything else is hard.\n\nEspecially when it comes to reining in JudeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trigger touch temper and LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s increasing jealousy of JudeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spirit Sister on the cheer squad whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attached herself to him in just about every way a girl could. Feeling the stress of trying to hang on to her quintessential bad boy while becoming the foremost dancer in her class, Lucy knows somethingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to break. She wants both. She needs both. But if she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make a choice, she risks losing everything.\n\nFor Lucy Larson and Jude Ryder, love might be the thing that just isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40e82bc6dd4c6d771d3c7fa43fed4a262f363582","amp;dn":"Clash+-+Nicole+Williams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40e82bc6dd4c6d771d3c7fa43fed4a262f363582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,232,43,198,221,76,109,119,29,60,127,164,63,237,74,38,47,54,53,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
