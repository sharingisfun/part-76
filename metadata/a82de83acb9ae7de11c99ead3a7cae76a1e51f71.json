The emergence of the serious games movement has capitalized on this interest in leisure gaming, with an increase in leisure game approaches in schools, colleges, universities and in professional training and continuing professional development.The movement raises many significant issues and challenges for us. How can gaming and simulation technologies be used to engage learners? How can games be used to motivate, deepen and accelerate learning? How can they be used to greatest effect in learning and teaching? The contributors explore these and many other questions that are vital to our understanding of the paradigm shift from conventional learning environments to learning in games and simulations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a82de83acb9ae7de11c99ead3a7cae76a1e51f71","amp;dn":"Digital+Games+and+Learning%2C+P.+Maharg%2C+S.+de+Freitas+%282011%29+%5B144","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a82de83acb9ae7de11c99ead3a7cae76a1e51f71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,45,232,58,203,154,231,222,17,201,158,173,58,124,174,118,161,229,31,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
