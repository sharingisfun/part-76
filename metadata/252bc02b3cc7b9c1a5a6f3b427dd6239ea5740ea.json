PROTECTION: Secu/Crap/EA: DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE: Sports\nNote: This release will update v1.5 of the game to v1.6\n\nFIFA 13 captures all the drama and unpredictability of real-world\nsoccer, and is driven by five game-changing innovations which\nrevolutionize artificial intelligence, dribbling, ball control and\nphysical play. It is the largest and deepest feature set in the history\nof the franchise. These innovations create a true battle for possession\nacross the entire pitch, deliver freedom and creativity in attack, and\ncapture all the drama and unpredictability of the real-world game\n\nFEATURES\nAttacking Intelligence - Players have the ability to analyse space, work\nharder and smarter to break down the defense, and think two plays ahead\nPlus, players make runs that pull defenders out of position and open\npassing channels for teammates\n\nComplete Dribbling - Face your opponent and use precise dribble touches\ncombined with true 360-degree mobility with the ball. Be more creative\nand dangerous in 1v1 opportunities\n\n1st Touch Control - A new system transforms the way players control the\nball, eliminating near-perfect touch for every player, and creating more\nopportunities for defenders to capitalise on errant balls and poor\ntouches to win back possession\n\n1.
