By all accounts it was a breathtaking, visually intimidating project dominated by special effects work the likes of which had not been seen before. Roughly telling the story of a Russian space crew sent to find out the fate of an earlier mission to intercept an alien probe on collision with earth, the movie combined DR. STRANGELOVE anticipating interior sets, functional looking science fiction props &amp; space wear, and miniature model effects that make the George Pal &amp; Captain Video oriented Americanized science fiction of the day look like laughable kitsch. Even the trend-setting science fiction work of Italian director Antonio Margheriti looks klunky and flimsy alongside of what is left of the movie.\n\nLanguage: Russian\n\nSubtitles: hard English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fba5abbd2d1cd11623ab26ad751e2ddf684dce9","amp;dn":"Nebo+zovyot+%281959%29+%5BThe+Sky+Calls%5D+%28DVDRip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fba5abbd2d1cd11623ab26ad751e2ddf684dce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,186,90,187,210,209,205,17,98,58,178,106,215,81,226,221,246,132,220,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
