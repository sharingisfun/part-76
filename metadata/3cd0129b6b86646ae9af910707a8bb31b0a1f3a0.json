He is known for his appearances in television specials,\nstage productions, and British television series such as Trick of the Mind and Trick\nor Treat. Since the first broadcast of his show Derren Brown: Mind Control in 2000,\nBrown has become increasingly well known for his &quot;mind-reading&quot; act. He has written\nbooks for magicians as well as the general public. His caricature artwork has received\ngallery exhibition and is available in a single volume documenting his portrait\ncollection\n\n&quot;Derren Brown: Apocalypse&quot; is a two-part special that aired on Friday 26 October 2012\nand concluded on Friday 2 November 2012. It centred around one man named Steven, who\nhad been described as suffering from a 'lazy sense of entitlement'. In a trailer for\nthe show, he said he was &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;irresponsible&quot;, while his mother said that\nsometimes she felt like he didn't love her anymore.\n\nThe show was supposedly an opportunity to give Steven a second chance at life and making\nhim realise how important his life really is. The setup was that a meteor shower hitting\nEarth had caused the end of the world. Steven supposedly woke up two weeks after the\ndisaster in an abandoned military hospital to find that he is one of a group of survivors\nnow living in a zombie wasteland. He made his way through a carefully planned storyline.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/3abX7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/3abX7.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/JgaIN.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/JgaIN.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/kWXkZ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/kWXkZ.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 1012 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 602 Kbps\nDuration: 1h 28mn\nSample: No\nSubtitles: No\n\n\nContainer: avc1\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate: 1 500 Kbps / 1 500 Kbps\nResolution: 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.208\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\n\n\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 160 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels (Front: L R)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cd0129b6b86646ae9af910707a8bb31b0a1f3a0","amp;dn":"ch4+-+Derren+Brown+Apocalypse+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cd0129b6b86646ae9af910707a8bb31b0a1f3a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,208,18,155,107,134,100,106,233,175,145,7,7,168,187,49,176,161,243,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
