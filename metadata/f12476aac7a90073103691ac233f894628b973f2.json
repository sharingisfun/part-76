It would have been difficult for them to make an album that was more sonically uncompromising than their debut: Sugarland's mix of fierce guitar experimentation and expressive drumming, topped with alternately deadpan and imploring vocals, was bracing to say the least. While Sunshine adds more melody into this framework, Talk Normal do so subtly and thoughtfully, imbuing it into each part of their playing and singing rather than just trying to graft something more tuneful onto their stark dynamics. While Sugarland's alien rawness is missed occasionally, Sunshine reveals a Talk Normal that is a little more immediate and a lot more assured.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f12476aac7a90073103691ac233f894628b973f2","amp;dn":"Talk+Normal+-+Sunshine+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f12476aac7a90073103691ac233f894628b973f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,36,118,170,199,169,0,115,16,54,145,172,35,63,137,70,40,185,115,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
