TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll play seven-string guitars and think theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re right on the cutting edge of music, which is nonsense. I decided to put away my guitar and not use it at all on the Shineback album. Instead, I play keyboards, computers and some synth. There are moments of guitar work, but not from me. I thought IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d get in people who could really play.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSimon is joined by guitarists Matt Stevens (The Fierce And The Dead), Dec Burke (Frost*, Brave New Sky, Dec Burke Band), Hywel Bennett (Dec Burke Band) and Andy Ditchfield (DeeExpus). There are also contributions from drummer Henry Rogers (Touchstone, DeeExpus), bassist Paul Worwood (Tinyfish) and vocalist Danny Claire (Ion Blue, Michael Angelo).\n\nRise Up Forgotten, Return Destroyed has a concept running through every track, with lyrics written by Robert Ramsay of Tinyfish. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about a woman who takes a video camera inside her dreams, and films what she sees for a blog. Except that things go badly wrong for her,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ explains Godfrey.\n\n==========================================================================\n\nTRACK LISTING:\n\n\nPART 1 - RISE UP FORGOTTEN\n\n    MAY YOU LIVE IN INTERESTING TIMES (BLOG 1)\n    IS THIS THE DREAM?\n    UNDER MY FEET (BLOG 2)\n    BEDLAM DAYS\n    FAULTLINES\n    DRAWN OUTSIDE (BLOG 3)\n    HERE COME THE ENVOYS\n    CRUSH CULTURE\n\nPART 2 - RETURN DESTROYED\n\n    THE CLOCK OF THE LONG NOW\n    FEARS AREN'T TOYS\n    I CALLED HIM IN VAIN (BLOG 4)\n    PASSENGERS\n    XO VA YU\n    THE SAINT OF DOORS\n    RISE UP FORGOTTEN, RETURN DESTROYED\n    AS THE RAIN (BLOG 5)\n    ONE LAST PERFECT DAY\n    MYOWNDREAMLAND (FINAL BLOG)\n\n==========================================================================\n\nThis is my first torrent upload.
