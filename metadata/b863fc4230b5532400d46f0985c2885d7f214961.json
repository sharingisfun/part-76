Hard to fit into just one genre, the band is influenced by doom metal, black metal, sludge and punk among others.\n\nThe lyrical side of Horse Latitudes deals with the ambivalence of being a human both inside and outside the natural world, through symbolical and mythical representations and subjective explorations into oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal experience. That includes frustration towards the incompleteness of man-made concepts in light of the nature of the indescribable and uncontrollable non-human world, but also awareness of the potential of awakening through spiritual openness.\n\nThe debut album of Horse Latitudes, Gathering, was released on winter solstice of the year 2010 by UKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Aurora Borealis recordings. This was followed by a split 12Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ EP with the doom-death heavyweights Hooded Menace on Doomentia records in 2012. The second Horse Latitudes album, Awakening, was also released on Doomentia records. The year 2012 also saw the release of a very limited Horse Latitudes / Loinen split tape on the cult Russian label Quagmire.\n\nThe new Horse Latitudes record called Black Soil will be released as 12Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ LP and cassette tape on Doomentia Records in June 2013 to coincide the UK/Ireland tour in July.\n\n\nHorse Latitudes is:\nHarri - Drums and Vocals\nHeidi - Bass Guitar\nVellu - Bass Guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b863fc4230b5532400d46f0985c2885d7f214961","amp;dn":"Horse+Latitudes+-+Black+Soil+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b863fc4230b5532400d46f0985c2885d7f214961","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,99,252,66,48,181,83,36,0,212,111,9,133,194,136,93,127,33,73,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
