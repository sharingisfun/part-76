Do you think music is lame?  Do you think your ears are a couple of assholes and deserve to suffer greatly?  Then W.H.E.A.T. is the band for you.\n\nI promise, you will never hear another band worse than W.H.E.A.T.  Since 1998, W.H.E.A.T. have been honing their approach to making non-musical, non-art sounds that are designed specifically to be the most unlistenable garbage ever put to record.  Don't believe me?  Think you can do worse?  Hell, even Nickleback can't suck as hard as W.H.E.A.T. can.  Just listen, and within a few ear-splitting seconds, you'll be convinced that no one ever sucked like W.H.E.A.T.\n\nPresented here is W.H.E.A.T.'s complete discography from 2004-2011:\n\n- I Hear Instruments, But That's Not Music\n- The Microphone Off Sessions\n- Legends Of Tales, Many Ages Past\n- Taste The Rainbow (With Your Butthole)\n- Satire Doesn't Seem Like The Right Word When You've Taken It This Far\n- Unicorn Powerhouse\n- Nobody Does What We Do.  Nobody Can.  Nobody Wants To.\n- I Hope, For Your Sake, You Don't Hear From Us Very Soon\n- Diarrhonstipation\n- Brought To You By Condoms\n- Failed Instrumenstruations\n- I Just Want To Get My Dick In There\n- You should Never Have Trusted Us\n- We're B-Side Ourselves With Rage\n- Molten Feces\n- We're Not Even Trying Anymore\n- Bouncing Clowns And Silly Animals\n- You Wish We Wouldn't, But We're Gonna\n\nMost is 128kbps, but if you are an audiophile who cares about sound quality, this is the wrong torrent for you.  Several of these albums are recorded by a single microphone pointed in the general direction of the band, most include errors from the studio, and one is re-recorded from a cassette tape player using a male-to-male headphone cord.  If sound quality is an issue, go fuck yourself.\n\nSO...\n\nDon't enjoy, but PLEASE SEED anyway!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f855e3653d34d73d3560ccb30b6cf60a038ac3e3","amp;dn":"W.H.E.A.T.+Complete+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f855e3653d34d73d3560ccb30b6cf60a038ac3e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,85,227,101,61,52,215,61,53,96,204,179,11,108,246,10,3,138,195,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
