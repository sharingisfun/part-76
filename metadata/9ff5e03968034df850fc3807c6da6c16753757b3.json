What they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know is her trailblazing career was a happy accident. In this funny and intimate memoir, Penny takes us from the stage of The Jackie Gleason Show in 1955 to HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s star-studded sets, offering up some hilarious detours along the way.\n\nMy Mother Was Nuts is an intimate backstage pass to PennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal life, her breakout role on The Odd Couple, her exploits with Cindy Williams and John Belushi, and her travels across Europe with Art Garfunkel on the back of a motorcycle. We see Penny get married. And divorced. And married again (the second time to Rob Reiner). We meet a young Carrie Fisher, whose close friendship with Penny has spanned decades. And we see Penny at work with Tom Hanks, Mark Wahlberg, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert De Niro, and Whitney Houston.\n\nThroughout it all, from her childhood spent tap dancing in the Bronx, to her rise as the star of Laverne &amp; Shirley, Penny lived by simple rules: Ã¢â‚¬Å“try hard, help your friends, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get too crazy, and have fun.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With humor and heart, My Mother Was Nuts reveals thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no one else quite like Penny Marshall.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nActress, producer and director Marshall's frank and funny memoir about the path that led her from an ordinary childhood in New York City to Hollywood stardom. Marshall never planned to get into acting. But her mother, who ran a neighborhood dance and acrobatics school for children in the Bronx, always believed that &quot;every child should know what it feels like to entertain.&quot; So she began teaching her daughter the rudiments of physical movement before she was 1 year old. By the time Marshall was a teenager, she and the other girls her mother taught had performed at churches, charity events and telethons; they had even appeared on the Jackie Gleason Show. Dancing, however, was not Marshall's passion. A mediocre student with no idea what she would do with her life, she went to the University of New Mexico, a college that &quot;accepted anyone from out of state.&quot; A few years later, Marshall was a divorced UNM dropout who had lost custody of her child, but she had also started to find her niche as an actress through involvement in community theater. She went to Hollywood to join her brother Garry, who was building a career as a comedy writer for TV and got bit parts in such classic TV shows as That Girl and The Odd Couple. She finally came into her own in the mid-1970s as the star of the hit sitcom Laverne &amp; Shirley, and then in the '80s and early-'90s as the director of the hit films Big and A League of Their Own. Marshall is as candid about her failures (which include a painful second divorce from writer/comedian Rob Reiner) and her weaknesses (like the one she developed for drugs) as she is about her successes. With gratitude for a life lived on her own terms, she writes, &quot;I've been given my five minutesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and then some.&quot; Bold and irrepressibly sassy.\n\nMeet the Author\nPenny Marshall is an actress, producer, and director.
