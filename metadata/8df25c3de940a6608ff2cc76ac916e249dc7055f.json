But he doesn't want her money, only her suffering - and he will kill Lily if Sue doesn't follow his every command. With detailed instructions, the faceless abductor leads Sue into a blinding snowstorm on the longest night of the year to a place she has not traveled to since childhood. The voice on the other end of her cell phone somehow knows Sue's deepest, most chilling secret - an ominous incident from her past, buried long ago... Chasing the Dead is a fast-paced, ferociously tense supernatural thriller from the twisted mind of Star Wars horror novelist Joe Schreiber (Red Harvest, Death Troopers).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df25c3de940a6608ff2cc76ac916e249dc7055f","amp;dn":"Chasing+The+Dead+01+%28of+04%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df25c3de940a6608ff2cc76ac916e249dc7055f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,242,92,61,233,64,166,96,143,242,204,118,172,145,110,36,157,199,5,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
