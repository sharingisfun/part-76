For a loved one to walk out through the front door and never to return is one of the most heartbreaking, terrifying and harrowing experiences someone can go through. Not to know the fate of a person close to you is simply agonising Ã¢â‚¬â€œ did they choose to disappear? Were they involved in an accident or did something even worse befall them? Not knowing for sure and being uncertain as to whether you should be saying goodbye or waiting for news of their return makes for a life in limbo. Every day in the UK, a staggering 600 people go missing. Most return within 72 hours of disappearing but there are still a large number that are never seen again. Some are students who take off to distant countries without telling their parents and then disappear; some are husbands who have left the marital home to come to terms with their own problems, there are runaways, unexplained disappearances and missing parents. In this compelling book, journalist Rose Rouse is granted exclusive access to the mothers, brothers, sons, wives, sisters and daughters of those who have vanished without trace. Take 19-year-old Eddie Gibson who went missing in Cambodia in 2004 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his courageous mother just wants her son back; or Tyler Blake, whose mother went missing when he was three Ã¢â‚¬â€œ now nine years old, he desperately misses her and wants her back. Rose shares in the turmoil that they have endured in their quest to be reunited with these who have disappeared from their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e97bc72bfbfcad337a984e2d739e8a2889e151b","amp;dn":"Rose+Rouse+-+Missing+%28mobi+%2B+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e97bc72bfbfcad337a984e2d739e8a2889e151b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,151,188,114,191,191,202,211,55,169,132,226,215,57,232,162,136,158,21,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
