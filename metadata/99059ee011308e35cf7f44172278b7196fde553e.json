Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game.[8] According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering with things.\n\n\nInfo:\nAudio: Eng/Jap\nSubs: Eng\nQuality: Medium/High\nFormat: .mkv\nSize/ep: 80MB +/-\nEncoder: Frozen_Solid [F-D]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99059ee011308e35cf7f44172278b7196fde553e","amp;dn":"%5BF-D%5DSteins+Gate+%5BDual-Audio%5D+%5B480P%5D%5BPart+1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99059ee011308e35cf7f44172278b7196fde553e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,5,158,224,17,48,142,53,207,127,68,23,34,120,183,25,111,222,85,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
